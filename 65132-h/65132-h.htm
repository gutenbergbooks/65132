<p><span class="xlarge">T</span>HE most beautiful place which can
be found on earth of a June morning is
a New England pasture, and fortunate
are we New Englanders who love the
open in the fact that, whatever town or
city may be our home, the old-time pastures
lie still at our very doors.</p>

<p>The way to the one that I know best
lies through the yard of an old, old
house, a yard that stands hospitably always
open. It swings along by the ancient
barn and turns a right angle by a
worn-out field. Then you enter an old
lane leading to what has been for more
than a century a cow pasture. Here the
close-cropped turf is like a lawn between
the gray and mossy old stone fences that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span>
the farmer of a century and more gone
grubbed from the rocky fields and made
into metes and bounds. There they stand
to-day, just as he set them, grim mementos
of toil which the softening hand
of time has made beautiful. Where
cattle still travel such lanes day by day
these walls are undecorated, but many
of the lanes are untraveled and have
been so these fifty years. Such are garlanded
with woodbine, sentineled by red
cedars, and fragrant with the breath of
wild rose, azalea, and clethra.</p>

<p>Side by side with this lawn-like lane
is another which was once traversed by
the cattle of the next farm, but which
has not been used for a lifetime. In
this the wild things of the wood are
untrammeled, save by one another, and
they hold it in riotous possession. Just
as the first lane is tame and sleek this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</span>
other is wild and unkempt. The raspberry
and blackberry tangle catches you
by the leg if you enter, as if to hold you
until birch and alder, cedar and sassafras,
look you over and decide whether
or not you are of their lodge. If you
give them the right grip you may pass.
If not, you will be well switched and
scratched before you are allowed to
go on.</p>

<p>Here the wild grape climbs unpruned
from wall to cedar, from cedar to birch
and from birch to oak, whence it sends
its witching fragrance far on the morning
air. You may stalk a wild grape
in bloom a mile by the scent and be well
rewarded by finding the very place
where the air tingles with it.</p>

<p>This lane is wild, and the wild things
of the woods that come on fleet wing
and nimble foot frequent it. You may<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span>
never see a partridge in the sleek lane,
and if by chance the red fox crosses it
he does so gingerly and as if it were
hot under foot. In the other, however,
the fox may slink for an hour unscared,
waiting with watchful eye on the neighboring
chicken coop, the red squirrel
builds his nest in the cedar, and the
partridge leads her young brood among
the blackberry bushes of an early
morning.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i006.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">The fox may slink for an hour unscared, waiting with watchful<br />
eye on the neighboring chicken coop</p>

<p>The azalea sends out its white fragrance
from the one lane, and never a
buttercup, even, nods to the wind in the
other; yet you love the smooth shorn
one best. It talks to you of the homely
life of the farm, the lazy cattle drowsing
contentedly to the barn at milking time
while the farmer&#8217;s boy sings as he puts
up the bars behind them. You love it
best because, however much you may<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span>
love the wild things, the lure of the
home-leading and well-trodden paths is
strong upon you. It is more than a
sturdy, rough-built stone wall that separates
the two lanes; there is all the
long road from the wilderness down to
civilization between them.</p>



<p>For the story the pasture teaches us,
more than anything else is the story
of how the fathers wrested the dominion
of the New England earth from
the wilderness and of the way in which
the wilderness still hems their world
about and not only waits the opportunity
to spring upon us and regain possession,
but invests our fields like an
invading army and takes by stealth
what it may not win by force.</p>

<p>The pasture bars divide the world of
the smooth-trodden lane and the close-shorn
fields from the picket line of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span>
wilderness. Let us pause a moment
upon the line of demarcation. Behind
us are the entrenchments of civilization,
the farmhouse and barn and other
buildings,&mdash;its fort. The town road is
the military way leading from fortified
camp to fortified camp, the mowing field
its glacis, and the stone walls its outer
entrenchments. These the cohorts of
the wilderness continually dare, and are
kept from carrying only by the vigilance
of the farmer and his men.</p>

<p>Let but this vigilance relax for a
year, a spring month even, and bramble
and bayberry, sweet-fern and wild rose,
daring scouts that they are, will have
a foothold that they will yield only
with death. Close upon these will follow
the birches, the light infantry
which rushes to the advance line as soon
as the scouts have found the foothold.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span>
These intrench and hold the field desperately
until pine and hickory, maple
and oak, sturdy men of the main line
of battle, arrive, and almost before you
know it the farm is reclaimed. The
wilderness has regained its lost ground
and the cosmos of the wild has wiped
out that curious chaos which we call
civilization.</p>

<p>In this debatable land of the pasture,
this Tom Tiddler&#8217;s ground where the
fight between man and the encroaching
wilderness goes yearly in favor of the
wilderness, dwell the pasture people.
The woodchuck, the rabbit, and even
the fox have their burrows here, the
woodchuck and the rabbit finding the
farmer&#8217;s clover field and garden patch
a convenient foraging ground, the fox
finding the chicken coop and the rabbit
equally convenient.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span>The pasture is the happy hunting-ground
of the hawks and owls, though
they dwell by preference in the deep
wood, the nearer approaching to the
forest primeval the better, but the crow
often nests in a pine among a group of
several in the pasture. The pasture is
peculiarly the home of scores of varieties
of what one might term the half
wild birds, the thrushes from honest
robin down to the catbird, warblers,
finches, and a host of others who are
as shy of the deep woods as they are
of the highway; and here, in those
magic hours that come between the first
faint flush of dawn and sunrise, you
may hear the full chorus of their matins
swell in triumphant jubilation.</p>

<p>Here in Eastern Massachusetts the
dawn comes early, very early, in June.
It will be a little before three that if<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span>
you watch the east you will see it flush
a bit like the coming of color on the
face of a dark-tressed maiden who has
had sudden news of the coming of her
lover. This flush of color fades again
soon, and it is evident that it is all a
mistake, for the darkness grows thicker
than ever, and night, like that of the
Apocalypse, is upon the face of the
world. The dawn is long coming when
you wait for it. Joshua evidently has
arisen and is holding the sun in Syria
as of old, that he may have time further
to confound his enemies.</p>

<p>No one believes that there will be
dawn at all. You cannot prove it by the
wood thrush. He sings best, indeed he
sings only, in the shadow, and often
even in the darkest night he will send
out a bell-like note or two that has a
soothing, sleepy tintinnabulation as of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>
cow-bells shaken afar off by drowsy cattle.
No, the wood thrush is not a reliable
witness, but if you are wise in the ways
of field and pasture before dawn, you
may take evidence from the chipping
sparrow. He is the earliest as he is
one of the smallest of the morn-waking
birds. In his case the least shall be
first. I do not know if he really sees
the dawn or if he smells it. There is a
change in the air before there is in the
sky, and perhaps he notes it. Perhaps,
too, being smaller, he needs less sleep
than the other birds, and his gentle inquiring
note is a plaint that the night
is long rather than a prophecy that it
is ending. But it is he that first predicts
with certainty the coming day, and
it will be many minutes after his first
call before the growing luminosity, a
sort of pale halo that looms slowly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span>
about all things, tells you that the sun
is indeed coming. Even then you are
likely to hear no other bird note for
what seems a long time.</p>

<p>Then from a treetop in the open
comes a sort of surprised ejaculation, as
if some one said, &#8220;Why, bless me! It
is morning already,&#8221; and then a burst
of song from the full throat of a robin.
It is as if he were the chorister of a
choir invisible, for he pipes but a single
strain before from treetop to treetop,
near and heaven only knows how far,
bursts forth the mingled melody of a
great chorus of robins ringing clarion
notes of jubilee.</p>

<p>They have the overture to themselves
all along in the open, for there the
song sparrow does not sing till some
ten minutes later. Of these again you
shall hear a single bird, followed by a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>
chorus in the next breath, and close
upon the heels of the sparrow voice
come the notes of innumerable warblers
of many kinds whose songs you shall
not distinguish one from another and
name unless you are an expert. Behind
these again come the chewinks and
thrashers, not so early risers by any
means, and very late the catbird. The
catbird is clever but, like many clever
people, he is lazy.</p>

<p>Over to the other side of the pasture,
a mile from the lane as the crow flies,
is a swamp which is part of the pasture,
indeed, but a part of the wilderness
beyond, also. It was on the edge
of this that I had chosen to meet the
dawn, picking my way to it through the
darkness in part by scent, for the swamp
has a musky fragrance of its own, which
it sends far on the night air. Coming<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>
down the slope to it you pass through
a tangle of scrub oak that leads you to
a lower region of alders snarled with
greenbrier&mdash;&#8220;horse brier&#8221; we call it
familiarly.</p>

<p>Here the ground begins to be soft,
with occasional clumps of sphagnum
moss, which is like a gray-brown carpet
of velvet, not yet made up, but tacked
together with yellow bastings of the
goldthread. Among the scrub oaks a
stately pine here and there shoulders
up, sending you a reassuring sniff of
pitchy aroma. The scrub oaks know
their allotted ground and cease wandering
when their toes touch swamp water,
but the pines are more venturesome,
and often lift with their roots little
mounds of firm brown carpeted ground
in the midst of the quaky sphagnum.
Slender cedars crowd in from the swamp<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span>
toward these pines, plumed like vassal
knights that rally to the support of
their overlord.</p>

<p>On one of these pine islands on the
edge of the swamp an oven bird had
built her nest, and on this particular
night in June she was in much distress
because she could not get into it. The
oven bird builds a nest on the ground
among low bushes and vines, choosing
often a spot where pine needles are
scattered among the dead leaves. She
roofs this nest with care&mdash;and dried
grass&mdash;and builds a tunnel-like entrance
to it so that you may see neither the
eggs nor the bird sitting on them. You
may step on an oven bird&#8217;s nest before
you will see it, even when looking for
it, and you may know for a certainty
that it is within a definite small patch
of ground, and yet hunt long before<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span>
you find it. The mother bird had been
frightened from her nest by the crush
of my foot at its side in the darkness,
and she did not dare come back, for I
had unwittingly sat down beneath the
pine almost across the entrance. Frightened
for her nest as well as herself,
she fluttered about like a bird ghost,
now dozing in the thicket for a time,
then waking to strangeness and fear,
and making her plaint again.</p>

<p>The wood thrush, brooding her eggs
in the thicket near by, heard it and
was wakeful, and her mate, never far
off, now and again lifted his head from
beneath his wing and drowsily tintinnabulated
a reassuring note or two, but
I did not stir. I was not sure that I
was the cause of the oven bird&#8217;s trouble,
and if so to move about in the darkness
might well bring her worse disaster.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span>The false dawn reddened and vanished,
the gray of the real dawn was
streaked and then flushed with rosy
light shot through with gold, and a
thousand voices of jubilee rang from
treetop to treetop the whole pasture
through and far out into the wood beyond,
and still I waited, stretched motionless.
A man might have thought
me dead, the victim of some midnight
tragedy, but the denizens of the pasture
are wiser in their own province than
that.</p>

<p>In the gray of that first dusk, that
was hardly streaked with the reassuring
red of dawn, a crow slipped silent and
bat-like from the top of a neighboring
pine. In that twilight of early dawn
you could not see him continually as he
flapped along. The motions of his
wings gave him strange appearances<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span>
and disappearances as if he dodged back
and forth, flitting up under cover of
pillars of mist, yet there was no mist
there, only the uncertainties of early
light which seems to come in squads
rather than in company front. This
crow turned suddenly in his flight as he
neared my pine island in the swamp and
lighted in noiseless excitement on a dead
limb. A moment he craned his neck,
peering sharply at my motionless figure.
The crow is at times a scavenger, and
if there were dead men about he wanted
to know it. For that matter if there
was anything else about he wanted to
know it, for the crow is likewise a gossip.
A moment then he gazed at the
motionless figure, then he vaulted from
the limb and the vigor of his call resounded
far and near as he flapped
away eastward into the crimson.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span>&#8220;Hi! Hi! Hi!&#8221; he shouted. &#8220;Fellow
citizens, there&#8217;s a man in the woods
here. He is motionless, but he is only
making believe dead. Look out for
him!&#8221;</p>

<p>Far and near the cry rang and was
taken up by others of his tribe who
passed the word along. &#8220;There&#8217;s a man
in the woods!&#8221; they shouted, &#8220;look out
for him.&#8221; The birds singing near by
ceased their songs for a moment that
they might have a look at the man, for
they understand the crow&#8217;s note of
warning as well as if they too spoke
his language.</p>

<p>The thrushes were singing now, and
after a while the catbird, lazy reprobate,
awoke. He too, like the crow, is
a gossip, and more than that he is a
tease. He shook his head a little to
straighten the ruffled feathers of the neck,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span>
disturbed by their position for the
night. He stretched one leg and the
wing on that side simultaneously, then
the other leg and the other wing, a bird
yawn as expressive as the human one.
Then he cocked his head on one side
with a gesture of pleased surprise and
excitement and said, &#8220;Mi-a-aw!&#8221; He
too had seen the invader of the swamp.</p>

<p>The catbird is a good singer, that is,
a good mimic. His taste is good, too,
for he imitates only the best. Here in
the North he imitates the brown thrush,
no doubt, all things considered, our best
vocalist. So well does he imitate him
that you shall not say of a surety that
this is the catbird singing and yonder
is the thrush. In the South he imitates
the mocking-bird with equal fidelity. You
would say on casual acquaintance that
he was our ablest singer and most exemplary<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span>
bird as he masquerades in the
voices of others, but let him once be
frightened, or angered, or over-excited
about anything and the reprobate part
of him reasserts itself and he says &#8220;Mi-a-aw!&#8221;
Hence his name, the catbird.</p>

<p>The catbird, however, has the courage
of his convictions, and one of these convictions
is that he has the right to the
satisfaction of an ungovernable and
enormous curiosity. Bait your bird trap
in the woods with something which
strikes a bird as a curiosity that courts
immediate investigation and you will
catch a catbird. Other birds might start
for it but the catbird would distance
them. So, after saying &#8220;Mi-a-aw!&#8221; a
few times and drawing no response to
his challenge, he flew up to a twig
within a foot of my head, sat there a
moment, motionless except his beady<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span>
black eyes which traversed my form
from foot to head, finally resting on my
eyes. Inadvertently I winked; that was
the only motion I made, but it was
enough. With a flirt of his tail and a
flip of his wings the catbird was through
the thicket and out on the other side
like a gray flash, scolding away at the
top of his voice and seeming to shout
as the crow had, &#8220;There&#8217;s a man in
the wood! There&#8217;s a man in the wood!
Look out for him!&#8221;</p>

<p>The crimson and gold of the dawn
had softened and diffused into diaphanous
mother-of-pearl mists of early day.
The June morning miracle was complete
and it was high time I allowed the oven
bird to come back and be assured that
her nest and eggs were safe.</p>

<p><span class="xlarge">I</span>T was to be a moonlight night, yet
the moon was on the wane and would
not rise until eleven. It seemed as if the
pasture birds missed the moon, or expected
it, for beginning with the June
dusk at eight o&#8217;clock one after another
made brief queries from red cedar shelter
or greenbrier thicket. One or two
indeed insisted on pouring forth snatches
of morning song, sending them questing
through the darkness for several minutes,
then ceasing as if ashamed of having
been misled.</p>

<p>The cuckoo, of course, you may hear
often on any warm night, springing his
watchman&#8217;s rattle chuckle from the denser
part of the thicket. But for the brown<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span>
thrush to be announcing morning every
half-hour through the darkness was an
absurdity to be accounted for only on
the theory that here was a gay young
blood who was practising for a moonlight
serenade. And when the moon
did come, touching the tops of the pines
first with a fine edging of gold, dropping
a luminous benediction to the
birches and diffusing it lower and lower
till the whole pasture was gold and
dusk, the ecstasy of the thrush knew
no limit. He poured forth a perfect
uproar of liquid melody, punctuated with
such hurroos and whoops of delight that
he made me wonder if his lady love
would like such college-song methods of
serenading.</p>

<p>I sat up from my couch on the green
moss under the huckleberry bush to
listen. The people of the pasture seemed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span>
to have trooped up to the call of the
music. The red cedars, the birches, the
huckleberry bushes in the daytime have
individuality indeed, but in the night-time
they have personality. They loom
up in spots where by day you did not
notice them at all. Some red cedars
stand erect and stiff as military men
might on sentinel duty, others gowned
in black like monks of old group together
and seem to consult, while all
about them mingling in gracious beauty
are the birches and the berry bushes,&mdash;the
birches slender, dainty aristocrats
gowned in the thinnest of whispering
silk, the berry bushes sturdy and comfortable
in homespun. You are half
afraid of the cedars, they are so black
and seem to watch you so intently,
more than half in love with the birches,
so graceful and enticing, as they lean<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span>
toward you in their diaphanous drapery,
but it is the berry bushes shouldering
up to greet you in hearty bourgeois
welcome that make you feel at home.</p>

<p>I listened to the thrush, but soon I
found that I had only one ear to do it
with, for on the other side of me a bird
was rapidly approaching with greater
and equally persistent clamor. It was
a whip-poor-will, seemingly roused to
rivalry by the challenge of the thrush.
So far as I know the thrush paid no
attention to him but simply kept up his
song in the birch near by, but the whip-poor-will
came up little by little till he
seemed almost over my head, and I
could hear plainly the hoarse intake of
breath between each call. Very brief
gasps these intakes were, for the whip-poor-wills
fairly tumbled over one another
without cessation.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span>Now the bird went away for a distance,
again he came back, but always
he kept up his call, while the thrush
never wavered from his perch in the
birch. A dozen times I waked in the
night to find them still at it, and when
the gray of dawn finally silenced the
whip-poor-will, the thrush let out like
a tenor that has just got his second
wind. He sang up the dawn and the
grand matutinal bird chorus, and the
last I heard of him he was still sitting
on his perch greeting the gold of the
morning sun with melodious uproar.</p>

<p>A blind man who knows the pasture
should know what part of it he is in
and the pasture people that are about
him of a June morning simply by the
use of his other senses. The birds he
would know by sound, the shrubs and
trees by smell. Each has its distinctive<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span>
set of odors differing with differing circumstances,
but never varying under
the same conditions. The barberry
fruit when fully ripe, especially if the
frost has mellowed it, has a faint,
pleasant, vinous smell which, with the
crimson beauty of the clustered berries,
might well tempt our grandmothers to
make barberry sauce, however much the
men folk might declare that it was but
shoe-pegs and molasses.</p>

<p>The blossoms are equally beautiful in
their pendant yellow racemes which
seem to flood the bush with golden
light, but the odor of the blossoms,
though the first sniff is sweet, has an
after touch which is not pleasant.
Crush the leaves as you pass and you
shall get a smell as of cheap vinegar
with something of the back kick of a
table d&#8217;h&ocirc;te claret. Crush the leaves of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span>
the swamp azalea and get a strawberry-musk
flavor that is faint but delightful.</p>

<p>Sniff as you shoulder your way
through the high blueberry bushes and
you may note that the crushed leaves
have a certain vinous odor like one of
the flavors of a good salad. The blossoms
of the high-bush blackberry, whose
thorns tear your hands, have a faint and
endearing smell as of June roses that
are so far away that you get just a
whiff of them in a dream. The azalea
that a month later will make the moist
air swoon with sticky sweetness now
gives out from its leaves something that
reminds you of wild strawberries that
you tasted years ago. It is as delicate
and as reminiscent as that.</p>

<p>Under your foot the sweet-fern
breathes a resin that is &#8220;like pious incense
from a censer old,&#8221; the bayberry<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span>
sniffs of the wax of altar candles
lighted at high mass in fairy land,
and over by the brook the sweet-gale
gives a finer fragrance even than these.
There are but three members of this
family,&mdash;the Myrica or Sweet-Gale family,&mdash;yet
it is one that the pasture
could least afford to miss. The fragrance
of their spirits descends like a
benediction on all about them, and I
have a fancy that it is steadily influencing
the lives of the other pasture folk.
I know that the low-bush black huckleberry,
the kind of the sweet, glossy
black fruit that crisps under your teeth
because of the seeds in it, grows right
amongst sweet-fern whenever it can.
Now if you crush the leaves of the low-bush
black huckleberry you shall get
from them a faint ghost of resinous
aroma which is very like that of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span>
sweet-fern. Thus do sweet lives pass
their fragrance on to those about them.</p>

<p>Many of these familiar odors had
come to me during the night as I half
slept and half listened to the vocal duel
between the thrush and the whip-poor-will,
but as I sprang to my feet at sunrise
from my dent in the pasture moss
I got a whiff of another which seemed
more subtly elusive, more faintly fine
than these, perhaps because, though I
seemed to recognize it, I could not
name it.</p>

<p>Many things I could name as I have
named them here, but this escaped me.
It had in it some of that real fragrance,
a joy without alloy, which you get in
late July or August from the clethra,
the white alder which lines the brook
and the pond shore with its beautiful
clusters of odoriferous white spikes.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span>
But by no stretch of the imagination
could I bring the white alder to bloom
in early June. Moreover, it had only a
suggestion of that in its purity of fragrance.
There was more to this. There
was a spicy, teasing titillation that
made me think of bubbles in a tall
glass, and it is a wonder that that
thought did not name it for me, but it
didn&#8217;t.</p>

<p>The sun was tipping the dew-wet
bush tops with opal scintillations that
soak you to the skin as you shoulder
through them, but that did not matter;
I was dressed for it, and so on I went,
taking continual shower-baths cheerfully,
but always with that teasing, alluring
scent in my nostrils. Now and then I
lost it; often it was confused and overridden
by other stronger odors. Once
I forgot it.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span>That was when I sprang over a
stone wall and landed fairly in the middle
of a covey of partridges made up of
a mother bird and what seemed a small
whirlwind of young ones no bigger
than my thumb. My plunge startled
the mother so that she thundered away
through the bushes, a thing that a
mother partridge, surprised with her
young, will rarely do. At the same
moment the young scurried into the
air. It was like a gust among a dozen
brown leaves, whirling them breast
high for a moment and then letting
them settle to earth again. You go to
pick them up and they surely are brown
leaves! It is as if some woodland
Merlin had waved his wand. They
were young partridges, they are brown
leaves. It is as quick as that.</p>

<p>Yet this was my lucky morning, for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span>
one of these little birds failed to dematerialize,
and I noted him wriggling
down under a clump of woodland grass
and picked him up. He made pretense
of keeping still for a moment, then
wriggled in fright in my hand, a
pathetically silent, frightened, bright-eyed
little chick, mostly down. How
his few feathers helped him to make as
much of a flight as he had is beyond
my conception. He must have mental-scienced
himself up into the air and down
again.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i038.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">The mother bird, dancing and mincing along</p>

<p>Holding him gently, I pursed my lips
and drew the air sharply in between lips
and teeth. The result was a peculiar
squeaking chirp which I have often
used on similar occasions with many
different birds and almost always with
success. Then there came a sudden
materialization. Out of the atmosphere,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span>
apparently, appeared the mother bird,
dancing and mincing along toward me
till she was very near, her head up, her
eyes blazing with excitement, her wings
half spread and her feathers fluttering.</p>




<p>It was a sort of pyrrhic dance by a
creature as different from the usual
partridge as may be conceived. It
lasted but a moment; at a sudden, indescribable
note from the mother bird
the fledgling gave an answering jump
and slipped from my relaxed hold, fluttered
and dematerialized before my eyes
just as the mother bird went into nothingness
in the same way. Truly, there
are bogies in the wood, for that morning
I saw them at their work. It was
the illusion and evasion of old Merlin;
no less.</p>

<p>Going on down the pasture, I picked
up the musky scent of the swamp I was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span>
approaching, instead of the thing I
sought. The scent of the swamp is
cool with humid humus, musky with the
breath of the skunk-cabbage, woodsy
with that quaint exhalation which you
get from the ferns, our oldest form of
plant life, still retaining and lending to
you as you pass the odor of the very
forest primeval. These are the base, and
they carry the lighter and daintier odors
as ambergris, a vile and dreadful but
very strong smell, carries the dainty
scents of the perfumer, and just as they
in turn give you no hint of the ambergris
which is their base, so the odor of
the swamp gives you little hint of these
three but is a delight of its own.</p>

<p>Beyond the little corner which I must
cross in the straight line I had taken
was a small hillock of open pasture,
fringed on the farther side with alder<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span>
and button bush which stand ankle deep
in the water of the pond. Here on the
little knoll daisies sent out that faint,
hay-like smell which is common to most
of the composit&aelig;. The squaw weed in
the meadowy edge between the swamp
and the knoll had given me the same
fragrance. But standing on the top of
the knoll while the soft morning wind
swept the daisy fragrance by me knee
high, I caught, head high, the elusive,
alluring odor that I was seeking. It led
me down to the pond side and called me,
dared me, to come on. Why not? I
was dressed for it, and I was wet to the
skin with the drench of the morning
dew already.</p>

<p>The cove was but a hundred yards
across, and I stood on the bank wishing
to note carefully the direction I must
take. The lazy morning wind drifted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span>
across, just kissing the water here and
there, leaving the surface for the most
part smooth. I wet my finger and held
it up, dropping it cool side down till it
was level. It pointed exactly toward
the opposite point at the other side of
the cove and between it and the next
one. There a low, sloping, broad flat
rock hung with a canopy of green
leaves was the dock at which I might
land conveniently, and I splashed resolutely
into the water, scaring almost to
death with my plunge a big green frog
that was sunning himself on a little
foot-square cranberry bog island. He
gave a shrill little yelp of terror and
dived before I could.</p>

<p>Singular thing that little half squeak,
half screech, of alarm. I have heard a
girl make an almost identical sound
when coming suddenly on a particularly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span>
fuzzy and well-developed caterpillar.
Rabbit, dog, and bird have it as well;
indeed, it seems to be the one word
which is common to all races and to all
articulate creatures. Like the scent of
brakes it began with the beginning of
things and has survived all the changes
of creation.</p>

<p>The muskrat ferry is a pleasant one.
Little dancing sprites of mist, the height
of your head above water, tiptoe off
the surface and slip away as you swim
toward them. You may see these only
of a morning when you take the muskrat
ferry. They are invisible from the
shore or from the height of a canoe
seat.</p>

<p>It is probable that just as some of
the pasture people make sounds too
shrill or too soft for our human ears to
hear them, so there are other things<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span>
about the pasture less visible even than
the little mist folk that we might see
were our sight fine enough or soft
enough.</p>

<p>Two-thirds of the way across a little
puff of wind sparkled its way out from
the shore to meet me. It brought with
it, full and rich, the fragrance which
had led me so long; and as I looked
at the broad leaves overhanging my
rock port, their under sides and the
young shoots covered with a soft,
cottony down, I laughed to think that
I should not have known what it was
I sought. For it was there in plain
sight; indeed the rock was canopied
with it.</p>

<p>A long time I sat on that rock on the
farther side of the cove, the June sun
warming me, the fragrance of the fox-grape
blooms over my head alluring,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span>
soothing, wrapping my senses in a
dreamy delight.</p>

<p>He who would attempt to classify and
define the perfume that drifts through
the pasture from the bloom of the fox-grape
may. I only know that it makes
me dream of pipes of Pan playing in
the morning of the world, while all the
wonder creatures of the old Greek
myths dance in rhythm and sing in soft
undertones, and the riot of young life
bubbles within them.</p>

<p>The pasture, indeed, could ill afford to
lose the pious incense from the sweet-fern&#8217;s
censer, the fragrance of the altar
candles of the bayberry, and the subtle
essence of the sweet-gale. These are
the holy incense of the church of out-of-doors,
and it is well that we should always
find them when we come to worship;
yet he who would dare all to steal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span>
for one elusive moment the fragrance of
the deep heart of delight, let him come
to the pasture on just that rare, brief
period of all the year when the fox-grape
sends forth its perfume.</p>

<p><span class="xlarge">T</span>HE pasture meets the pond all along
for a mile or so. It lays its lip to it
and drinks only here and there. It
drinks deepest of all in a cove. You
will hardly know where pasture leaves
off and cove begins, the two mingle so
gently. The pasture creatures here slip
down into the cove, and those of the
pond make their way well up into
the pasture. You yourself, approaching
the cove from the pasture side on
foot, will be splashing ankle deep in it
before you know you are coming to it
at all, so well do the pasture bushes,
standing to their knees in the cool
water, screen it from you.</p>

<p>Coming from the pond side you might<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span>
think you saw the margin in this same
screen of bushes, but there are roods of
cove beyond and behind them. The
shrubs of the pasture love to come down
and dabble their feet in the warm pond
water and sun themselves in the sheltered,
fragrant air.</p>

<p>The afternoon sun has more resilience
here than elsewhere. It bounds
with fervent flashes of elasticity from
the glossy leaves of the bushes that
have waded out farthest and made
islands of themselves. The high-bush
blueberries are the most daring of all,
and stand in the largest clumps
farthest out. These, late in May with
an off-shore wind, shower the whole
surface of the water with their fallen
corollas. More than once have I seen
the cove white with them on Memorial
Day, as if the bushes, standing with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span>
bowed heads, strewed the waves with
memorial flowers for the pasture people
who have died at sea.</p>

<p>Earlier in the year the elms have
made the whole surface of the cove
brown with their round, wing-margined
seeds, and after the memorial
flowers of the blueberry bushes are
gone the maples will send out millions
of two-sailed seed boats, reddening the
whole surface with their argosies as
they go out to sea, wing and wing.
Now all these things have passed and
the surface of the water is clean again
to dimple with the under-water swirl of
a minnow-hunting pickerel or lap lazily
against your canoe with the dying undulations
of the waves from outside.</p>

<p>After the bold blueberry bushes, less
daring but still eager pasture people
have waded in and formed lesser<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span>
island clumps of their own. These were
led by the sweet-gale, holding her dark-green
silken skirt daintily up, so fragrant-souled
that she fears no evil,
trailed by the saucy wild rose, cheerful
spir&aelig;a, gloomy cassandra, and chubby
baby alders. If you watch these you
will note that they shiver in the lazy
breeze as if they feared the pass to
which their temerity may have brought
them. Yet there they stand, and the
miniature tides swirl about their pink
toes and die in the pools behind them, so
closely grow the sedges and little marsh
plants that fill them until the fishes from
the cove nose about their stalks in vain
attempt to enter.</p>

<p>Just outside the bush fringe, where
the maples are mirrored in undulations,
whirl and skip, each according to his
kind, the surface insects of the cove.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span>
Of these I hail with greatest joy, as any
boy should, the &#8220;lucky bug.&#8221; You
know the one I mean. He is a third of
an inch long, almost as broad, oval, a
sort of whaleback monitor without any
turret. He is hard shelled and a Baptist,
judged from the pertinacity with
which he sticks to deep water, but a
Baptist gone sadly wrong, for he
waltzes continually with his fellows.
Round and round they go in a mazy
whirl that would make you dizzy if at
the last gasp they did not reverse.</p>

<p>All boys who fish know that these
bugs carry stores of luck within their
hard shells, and for one even to approach
your line in his mad waltz is a
sign of coming success, and should he
actually touch the line and cling, it presages
a big fish. But if you would propitiate
the gods in most definite fashion<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span>
before you cast line you should catch
several lucky bugs, the more the better,
bury them on the bank with their heads
to the shore, and recite over them an
incantation as follows:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">&#8220;Bug, bug, bug,</div>
<div class="verse">I&#8217;ve spit on the worms I dug;</div>
<div class="verse">Bug, bug, give me my wish,</div>
<div class="verse">A great big string of great big fish.&#8221;</div>
</div></div>

<p>Properly managed this was never known
to fail; if it does it is because you have
buried one or more of your bugs bottom
up.</p>

<p>It is not so easy to catch a lucky bug,
however. He is a very modern type
of monitor, for his engine power is of
the highest, steam is always at the top
notch, and he can dart away in a
straight line with all the concentrated
fury of a torpedo boat. Moreover, he is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span>
convertible, and I have seen him when
completely surrounded by enemies become
a submarine and dive straight for
the bottom and stay there. He may
have an oxygen tank; anyway, he
doesn&#8217;t come up until he gets ready,
when he appears fresh and hearty and
ready for another waltz.</p>

<p>A fellow surface sailor of his, or
rather skipper, is a different type of
bug. This is the water-strider, a veritable
Cassius of the cove, with the lean
and hungry look of an overgrown, underfed
mosquito. There is no merry
waltz with his fellows about this
piratical-looking chap. He spreads his
four long legs like a Maltese cross, and
the tips of them are all that touch the
water. These dent it into minute dimples,
but do not penetrate, and his bug-ship
skips energetically about on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span>
four dents, hopping at times like a
veritable flea. Sometimes he jumps a
half-inch high and skitters along the
surface as a boy skips a stone; again he
poises, lowers his body till it all but
rests on the water, then raises it till he
is high on four stilts, and all the time
not even his toes are wet.</p>

<p>Entering the cove in mid-afternoon
you might think the swooning heat had
left it no life awake other than the
water insects and the dragon-flies that
race them in airship fashion above.
Yet you have but to ground your canoe
on a sedgy shallow, sit motionless, and
wait. Nor have you to wait long.
There is a breathless pause as if all
things waited to see what this leviathan
of the outer deep meant to do next;
then a voice at your very elbow says
reassuringly, &#8220;Tu-g-g-g!&#8221; That is as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span>
near as you can come to it with type.
There are no characters that will express
its guttural vehemence which
strikes you like a blow on the chest, or
its sympathetic resonance. Take your
violin, drop the G string to a tension so
low that it will hardly vibrate musically,
then twang it. That suggests the tone.
But you know it well enough without
description.</p>

<p>Immediately there comes an answering
chorus of &#8220;tu-g-gs,&#8221; here, there, in
a score of places all along the shore line
and among the island clumps of bushes,
prelude of frog talk galore for a
moment or two, followed by brief
silence. Then, taking advantage of the
oratorical pause, an old-timer sets up a
tremendously hoarse and vibrant bellow.
&#8220;A-hr-r-h-h-u-m-mm!&#8221; he says,
&#8220;A-hr-r-h-h-u-m-mm!&#8221; with the accent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span>
on the rum. You can hear him half a
mile, and immediately there is a
&#8220;chug-squeak-splash&#8221; from a little
fellow, as if, unable to furnish the
beverage at short notice, he became
affrighted and without delay decided
that a sequestered nook on bottom between
two stones was for him. Then
the cove goes to sleep again; you can
almost hear the silence snore.</p>

<p>Little by little, if you look about you
shall see them, some right within reach
of your paddle. I never know whether
they slip under when the canoe approaches
and bob up again noiselessly
after all is still, or whether they are
there all the time, only so well concealed
by nature that the eye does not note
them at first; but I do know that you
never see them until you have waited a
bit. Their brown backs are just under<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span>
water, their green-brown heads just
enough above the surface so that the
nostrils will get air; and there they
wait, motionless, for hours and hours,
for time and tide to serve luncheon.
Even with only the tops of their heads
visible they make you laugh, for their
pop eyes are popped so high above the
tops of their flat heads that they make
you think of automobile bug lights set
well up above the motor hood.</p>

<p>I note a shipwrecked June beetle
clinging half drowned to a spear of
grass and I toss him over within six
inches of a frog. There is a splash, a
gulp, and the beetle with his frantically
clawing, thorny-toed legs is passed
on to kingdom come without a crunch.
Once or twice after that this frog
stirred as if he had an uneasy conscience,
but he seemed to suffer no internal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span>
pangs, indeed he winked the circular
yellow lining of his eye at me
these times as if he enjoyed it. It had
all the effects of smacking the lips.</p>

<p>The afternoon dreams down from its
pinnacle of hazy heat to the soft level
of eventide. Under the pines of the
west side of the cove the level sun slips
in and seems to caress the green trunks,
and the tops above sing a little sighing
song of contentment. Strange you have
not heard this before, for the wind has
been there all the afternoon. But it is
toward nightfall that the cove wakes
up and you hear many lisping elfin
sounds that you have never noticed
during the mid-afternoon heat. You
hear the sedges talking in the undulations
now. You did not hear them before,
yet the undulations have been gliding
dreamily among the sedges all day.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span>
The pasture birds are waking up their
preludes of evensong, and the sun across
the cove to the west is glorifying all the
quivering canopy of green leaves through
which it shines with a luminous, diaphanous
quality which makes magic all
along that side of the cove.</p>

<p>You are on the borderland between
the clear definition of reality and the
mystic haze of nightfall. To the west,
looking away from the glow, all is
gently but clearly defined; to the east,
looking into the golden rose of the sunset
through the shimmering illusion of
leaves, lies the pathway to the land that
the king&#8217;s son saw in the Arabian
Night&#8217;s tale.</p>

<p>The nightly entertainment, the evening
minstrel show, is about to begin in
the cove, an entertainment in which the
frogs are the minstrels, an all star performance,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span>
for every one of them is capable
of being an end man or interlocutor
or soloist as the case may require.</p>

<p>Already the audience is beginning to
gather. First comes a gray squirrel
scratching down a maple trunk, his
strong clawed hind feet digging into the
bark and holding him wherever he wishes
them to, as if he were an inverted lineman.
Suddenly he sights the canoe and
its occupant and&mdash;blows up. Nothing
else will express his sudden outpouring
of scolding and denunciation of this
creature that has usurped a front seat.
The sounds burst out of him like the
escaping steam from a great mogul engine
waiting on a siding for its freight,
and he quivers from head to foot, like
the engine, with the intensity of the
ebullition. Suddenly there is a &#8220;quawk!&#8221;
directly over his head, a single cry shot<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span>
out from the catarrhal throat of a night
heron that is just sailing down. The
gray squirrel shoots three feet into the
air, lands on another maple, flashes up
a birch and goes crashing through the
birch tops off into the woods, where
you faintly hear him jawing still. The
night heron whirls with a great flapping
and puts to sea with more quawks
of alarm. But these two were not especially
wanted at the concert. The
night heron particularly is an unlovely
bird in appearance, voice, and manner.
The skippers and the lucky bugs crowd
in together, each among its kind, close
to the reedy margin, to be as near the
performers as possible, and behold, there
come sailing in from sea tiny argosies
of dainty people, the loveliest free swimmers
of the pond. Golden heads nodding
in gracious recognition, they come,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span>
slender bodied and graceful, trailing long
robes of filmy lace beneath them in the
water.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i064.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">Out from among the birches she sails gracefully, a veritable<br />
queen of the fairies</p>

<p>The botanists, who shall be hung some
day for their literalness, have named
these lovely denizens of the cove bladder-worts,
or <i>Utricularia</i>, if you wish the
Latin form, because they float on their
air-inflated leaves and trail their roots
beneath them, free in the water, scorning
the contaminating touch of earth.
The off-shore wind of noon had sailed
these out well beyond the mouth of the
cove, now the evening breeze is bringing
them in again for the concert.</p>

<p>They should have been named after
some dainty lady of the old Greek mythology,
some fair sailor lass who
crossed the wake of Ulysses, perchance,
and lingers on placid seas waiting his
return to this day, for you will see their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span>
golden heads nodding along on the little
waves of the cove all summer.</p>




<p>These are the patricians of the concert.
There is a great tuning of instruments
going on already and a trying
out of voices, yet for some reason
there is delay. Then comes the queen
herself. The golden shimmer on the
eastern shore has faded and dusk dances
up from the undergrowth on the west.
It is time, and out from among the
birches she sails gracefully, a veritable
queen of the fairies, clad in ostrich
plumes and softest of white velvet, with
the most beautiful trailing and undulating
opera cloak of softest, delicate green,
trimmed with brown and white. You
may call her a luna moth if you will.
The thing which somewhat resembles
her, stuck on a pin in your collection,
may be that, but this graceful, soaring<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span>
creature, pulsing and quivering with life,
floating through perfumed dusk, is the
queen of the fairies&mdash;no less.</p>

<p>Her arrival is a signal for the olio
to begin. Then, indeed, you learn the
astonishing number and variety of the
frog performers within the cove. The
basso profundos sing &#8220;Ah-r-h-u-m-m&#8221;
with amazing gusto. Surely that waiter
frog has got over his fright and brought
it in quantity. &#8220;T-u-g-gs&#8221; resound all
about like the rattle of a drum corps.
There are altos whose voices sound like
rasping a stick cheerfully on a picket
fence, others whose strain hath a dying
fall of internal agony outwardly expressed.
A lone belated hyla pipes his
plaintive soprano, but the tenors are the
strongest of all. The tree toad flutes a
fluttering, liquid tremolo, and the toad,
the common toad, sits on the grassy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span>
margin and swells his throat and sings
&#8220;Wha-a-a-a-&#8221; in long-drawn, dreamy
cadence.</p>

<p>You may imitate this sound after a
fashion if you wish. Purse your lips and
say the French &#8220;Eu&#8221; in a long drawl
once or twice, then the next time you
do it whistle at the same time. You
will have a very tolerable imitation of
this dreamy note. It invites to slumber
and it is time to paddle home, for the
dusk has deepened to darkness and there
is little more for you to see in the cove.</p>

<p class="ph1">A BUTTERFLY CHASE</p>
</div>


<p><span class="xlarge">I</span>T was a great purple butterfly which
led me over the brow of the hill, one of
the &#8220;white admirals,&#8221; curiously enough
so called, though this one had but four
minute spots of white on him near the
tips of his wings. Some members of
his genus have a right to the name for
they have broad bands of white across
all four wings, but this one, the <i>Basilarchia
astyanax</i>, is a black sheep.</p>

<p>Nevertheless he is a beautiful creature,
well worth following under any
circumstances to note the ease and sureness
of his floating flight and admire
the beauty of his velvety rufous-black,
shoaling into lustrous blue in the rounded
crenulations of the after wings. This<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span>
one I thought worth following for another
reason, however, for he seemed to
have something on his mind. Not that
his flight was direct. A bird with something
to do goes to his work in a
straight line; but a butterfly must dance
along, even if it were to a funeral in
the family. And yet with all this my
blue and rufous-black white admiral carried
in his dancing progress something
which told me he was troubled and led
me to follow him over the brow of the
hill.</p>

<p>The hill itself is worth noting. Here
the glaciers which some thousands of
years ago planed off the rougher surface
of eastern New England dropped
their chips in a vast terminal moraine
of sand and gravel, whose northern declivity
is so steep that you may throw
a stone from its rim to the top of a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span>
pine growing on the level, eighty or
ninety feet below. I know many terminal
moraines in New England; but I
know no other at once so high and so
abrupt in its declivity. A few rods back
from its summit the trolley car clangs
incessantly, and the speed-mad automobilist
tears hooting through.</p>

<p>Along the crest, in spite of this, sleep
peacefully the forefathers of the hamlet.
I like to feel that they neither note nor
heed the uproar of the highway; that they
now and then cock a pleased ear to the
rumble of a passing hay-cart or the jog
of a farmer&#8217;s horse, but that the bedlam
of modern hurry whangs by them
unperceived. Rather they turn their
faces to the sough of the summer winds
in the century-old pines which shade the
steep and sleep on, happy in the benediction
that descends from the spreading<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span>
branches. Wonderful pines, these, so
shading the whole declivity that not
more than a dapple of sunlight has
touched the ground beneath them for a
century.</p>

<p>Here the hepatica finds the cool, dry
seclusion that it loves and lifts shy blue
eyes to you while yet the winter ice
nestles beside it among the pine roots.
Here while the July sun distills pitchy
aroma from the great trees the partridge
berry carpets favored spots with the rich
green of its little round leaves,&mdash;leaves
no bigger than the pink nail of your
sweetheart&#8217;s little finger, a green figured
with the scarlet of last year&#8217;s berries and
the white of its wee starry twin flowers.
Here, too, in July the pyrola lifts its
spike of bells like a woodland lily-of-the-valley
and the pipsissewa shows its waxy
flowers to the questing bee.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span>A butterfly, especially a large butterfly,
rarely bothers with these low-growing
herbs, though each has its own
delicious fragrance&mdash;and a butterfly&#8217;s
scent is keen. So my black white admiral
alternately danced and soared on
down through the richly perfumed areas
of the wood while I plunged eagerly
after, glissading the needle-carpeted slope,
making station from trunk to trunk lest
a too headlong flight plunge me to oblivion
in what I knew was at the foot
of the hill.</p>

<p>Without, the perfervid July sun beat
upon the landscape till the dust of its
concussion rose in a blue haze that
loomed the nearby hills into misty
mountain tops and glamoured the whole
world with tropical illusion. To our
hard-cornered, clear-cut New England it
is the midsummer which brings the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span>
atmosphere of romance. The swoon
of Arabian Nights is upon the landscape,
and it is through such heat and
through such misty evasion that the
Caliph of Bagdad was accustomed to
set forth incognito to meet strange
adventures.</p>

<p>At the foot of the hill, almost at the
borderland which separates this under-pine
world from another far different,
the resinous air is shut in like the genie
in the bottle. You feel the oppression
of its restraint and wonder, if like the
fisherman you might uncork it, if it
would loom aloft in a dense cloud that
would speak to you in a mighty voice.
Here my butterfly paused for the first
time and lighted upon the trunk of a
pine, head high.</p>

<p>Quietly I drew near. His wings were
rising and falling in rhythmic unconscious<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span>
motion that was tremulous with
what seemed eagerness. One of them,
I noted, had a little triangular bit snipped
out of it with a clean cut. Some insect-eating
bird had snapped at him not long
before, and he had come within a half-inch
of death. Yet this did not trouble
him; very likely he never knew it. It
was something else which absorbed him
so that he took no notice of my close
approach. And now I could see that his
proboscis was uncoiled and apparently
he was eating rapidly. Now the proboscis
of any butterfly is simply a
double-barrelled tube through which he
sucks honey or other moist nutriment.
That a <i>Basilarchia astyanax</i>, or any
other butterfly for that matter, should
be able to draw nourishment from the
dry, rough bark of a pine-tree was sufficient
cause for astonishment, and I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span>
drew eagerly nearer to see what he
was getting.</p>

<p>It was a humid day and I was thirsty
myself. What woodland brew could be
on tap here? In Ireland it used to be
true that the Leprechauns, the little men
of the hedge, could make good beer of
heath, and if you could only catch and
hold one he would tell you how. Here
might be a similar chance. My nose was
within six inches of the white admiral&#8217;s
now and my eyes were bulging out with
surprise as much as his do naturally,
for behold he had what butterfly never
had before,&mdash;a little red tongue on the
tip of his proboscis, and with it he was
nervously licking the bark in its roughest
places as hard as he could.</p>

<p>I might have seen more had not my
foot slipped on the glossy pine needles,
and while I clutched the trunk of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span>
pine to save myself the butterfly danced
away, thinking, I dare say, that I was
an abnormally developed wood peewee
and had just missed getting him for
luncheon. Evidently the south wind
had blown up from the gulf more than
an Arabian Night&#8217;s atmosphere; it had
sent along portions of the fauna as
well. A butterfly with a tongue on the
end of his proboscis belongs in the land
where rocs pick up elephants in their
talons and soar away with them!</p>

<p>Eagerly I sought to follow my <i>Basilarchia
astyanax</i> and learn more, but it
was not so easy. To follow his flight
without care as to the setting of my
feet might well be to reach a country
undiscovered indeed, for from the very
bottom of the northern declivity of the
terminal moraine well the springs of
the fountain head, and out across these<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span>
he lightly floated, toward the sphagnum-bottom
pasture swamp beyond.</p>

<p>I suppose it is well settled, geologically,
that a river of pure water flows
from some distant northern point, Labrador
perhaps, under the eastern portion
of Massachusetts. Driven wells
find this water almost everywhere. In
places it rises to the surface in clear
ponds which have no apparent inlet,
and from which little water flows, but
which are clear and sparkling at a
good level the year round. Houghton&#8217;s
Pond, in the Blue Hill Reservation, is
one of these nearest Boston. Walden
Pond is another, and there are plenty
more.</p>

<p>In other places still the water boils
out of springs through quicksands of
unknown depths, flowing in clear
streams through surrounding swamps<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span>
where trees have made firm ground alternating
with bits of quaking bog and
open pools, where a misstep will drop
you over your head in a clinging mud
that never gives up what it once gets.</p>

<p>Such is the fountain head, and you
would know you were coming to it of a
hot day even were your eyes shut, for
the ice-cold water makes its own atmosphere.
We read of bodies of ice
that have lasted since the glacial age
buried under these terminal moraines
whence well such cooling springs; I do
not know about the ice, but I can testify
to the cold, sparkling water and the
grateful atmosphere which it disseminates
on these our Arabian days. Yet
you must mark well your going. Just
under the slope the water boils up
through fine sand that dances in the up
current. A few feet farther down it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span>
wells more silently, and the decayed
vegetation of centuries has made a mud
bank over the quicksand. You may
sink to the knee here and find bottom.
A few steps farther on you may drive a
twenty-foot pole down through mud
and sand and find nothing to obstruct it.</p>

<p>Yet Nature always provides the
remedy. Mosses and swamp grass
have grown on the surface of this
liquid mud and alders and swamp
maple have rooted in these and encouraged
wild rose and elder and many
another shrub, till their intertwined
roots have formed a surface which is
in part safe to the foot. And here is a
world of itself in this hidden pasture
corner, for here linger the trout and
the water-cress, and many another shy
woodland thing, driven to bay by the encroachments
of surrounding civilization.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span>In early July you will find the water-cress
in bloom in the open pools, surrounded
by quaking bog and alder
shade. Toward this my butterfly had
gone, and I followed, balancing warily
from clump to clump in the grateful
coolness, testing each foothold lest it
drop me into the clinging depths below
whence nothing but a derrick might
lift me. The arethusa, daintiest of
orchids, nodded its pink head at me
from the quaking sphagnum, daintily
bowing me on, but I paused a moment.</p>

<p>In the water right between my feet
was a spotted turtle that had just captured
an appetizing, but by no means
dainty morsel. This was a terrapin-like
bug that was more than a mouthful.
His body, indeed, was already out
of sight, but claw-like legs protruded
from both sides of that isosceles triangle<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span>
which a turtle&#8217;s mouth makes
when it is closed, and waved a frantic
farewell to the passing under-water
world. The turtle was a long time in
masticating his terrapin, but it was a
happy time. His whole body blinked
contentedly, and he waved his forelegs
with a caressing out-push, a motion exactly
like that of a child at the breast.
Then he wagged his head solemnly
from side to side as a wise turtle might
who feels that such good lunches are
put up by fate only for the knowing
ones of this watery world, and pushed
himself half way under the roots of a
tussock for a nap. Soon the nether
half circle of his shell was motionless,
with his hind legs drawn up within.
Only his little spike tail protruded,
waving to a wee passing trout the news
that the millennium was at hand, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span>
the turtle and the bug-terrapin had
lain down together in peace and prosperity,
with the bug-terrapin inside.</p>

<p>I looked up for the butterfly. He
was nowhere to be seen. Yet my trip
was to be worth while, for right in
front of me was an open pool surrounded
by a quaking bog, a pool
twenty feet across packed almost solid
with the white panicled heads of water-cress
blooms in which swarmed a
myriad of bees. Their drone was like
that at the front door of a hive on a
hot July day, yet it was not a monotone
as that is. It was rather like a
grand chorus singing many parts, for
these were all wildwood bees of a
dozen varieties. There was not a hive
tender among them.</p>

<p>Lifting my admiring gaze from the
pool with its white panicles and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span>
swarming bees I saw further beauty
beyond. On firmer ground nestling
lovingly against an old chestnut post
was a great, glorious spike of habenaria,
the purple-fringed orchis. It is
not uncommon, the habenaria, in peaty
meadows, but no man sees it for the
first time in the season without a great
glow of delight, and I hastened over to
give it nearer greeting. Just as I
reached it the butterfly came dancing up,
but not to sip the sweets of the wonderful
great orchid. Instead he lighted,
right under my nose, on the roughest
part of the old fence post and began to
lick this as he had the pine trunk.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i086.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">There was the swish of wings, the snip-snap of a bird&#8217;s beak,<br />
and it was all over</p>

<p>I watched him again, hearing subconsciously
the voice of a great crested
flycatcher over on a nearby tree, crying
&#8220;Grief,&#8221; &#8220;Grief.&#8221; A moment and
the little red tongue which I had noted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span>
before seemed to catch on the roughest
part of the old fence post, and with a
sudden scrape the Basilarchia scraped
it off. I looked in amaze, for now I
saw what it was. From the honey
heart of some flower a little red worm
had become attached to the tip of the
butterfly&#8217;s proboscis, and all this licking
of rough surfaces had been merely to
get rid of him.</p>

<p>Up into the bright sunshine danced
my black white admiral. There was the
swish of wings, the snip-snip of a bird&#8217;s
beak, and it was all over. The cry of
the great crested flycatcher had been a
prophecy indeed, and the white admiral
had danced blithely out of existence.</p>

<p>But the equatorial haze had more
tropical enchantment in store, for the
midday sun was suddenly wiped out by
an ominous figure. Some one had uncorked<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span>
that bottle which held the heat
genie confined, and he was looming
from a black nimbus below into white
piles of cumulus at the zenith. His
eyes flashed red lightnings and he spoke
in thunder tones. Somewhere over yonder
I heard the great crested flycatcher
crying &#8220;Grief,&#8221; &#8220;Grief,&#8221; again. It
might be my turn next, and I patted
the great orchid good-by and tiptoed
through the sphagnum and climbed the
hill again. It had been a brief but
pleasant trip. A butterfly that found a
tongue and a turtle that ate terrapin with
a happy smile may belong with the
genie in the Arabian Nights, or with
Alice in Wonderland, or both. I know
that I found them at the fountain head,
under the grove of immemorial pines,
below the brow of the terminal moraine
where sleep the fathers of the hamlet.</p>

</div>


<p><span class="xlarge">I</span>F you have ever known fishing, real
fishing, not the guide-book kind, where
you &#8220;whip&#8221; streams for fancy fish that
bite mainly in fancy&mdash;there will come a
day in late July when it will be necessary
for you to go down stream. The
excessive heat and humidity which has
been killing you off by inches and
other people by wholesale for weeks
will suddenly vanish before a cool, dry
northwester, a gladsome reminder to
the New Englander that there is such
a thing as winter after all; thank
Heaven!</p>

<p>You know that the drought diminished
waters still fizz out from under<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span>
the dam and purl into the pool below
the roadside where the sunfish congregate
under the water weeds. Beyond
this they prattle down the meadow under
banks where the hard-hack stands pink
and prim, where the meadow-sweet loves
the stream so much that it bends
toward it and half caresses, and where
the meadow grasses in complete abandonment
whisper of it in every wind
and bend down and surreptitiously kiss
it as it dimples by. Farther down
where the woodland maples troop up
to meet it and the willows sit and
bathe pink toes in the current is the
big rock, under which the current has
dug a sandy cave in which linger big
yellow perch, ready to rush out and
snatch the worm that comes floating
down stream. Here you will hesitate
but finally pass on, for there is a lure<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span>
which you cannot withstand in the deep
pool farther down.</p>

<p>Because you are wise with the remembered
wisdom of boyhood, you have
left at home the expensive rod and reel.
Just back from the swamp edge is a
birch jungle where young trees stand
as thick as canes in a Cuban brake.
Here you find your pole; as large as
your thumb at the butt, tapering,
straight, clean and strong, fifteen feet to
the tip. Cut it and trim the limbs from
it and bend to it your ten feet of stout
line at the end of which is a hook
whose curve is as big as that of your
little finger nail. A cork that would fit
a quart bottle will fit your line if you
gash it with your pocket-knife and slip
the line in the gash. It will hold
wherever you put it, yet you may slide
it up and down at will. For the pool<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span>
you should put it three feet from your
hook, for you will wish to &#8220;sink&#8221; that
deep. Wind a wee bit of lead about
your line an inch above the hook, then
pull out your bait box and select a fat
angle-worm. Break him in two in the
middle and string him on the hook so
that the point is just inside the tip of
his nose. Now you are ready for what
adventure may lurk under the bubbly
foam of the surface.</p>

<p>A willow and a maple lean together in
loving embrace over the entrance to the
deep pool. Above, their arms stretch
toward one another and intertwine; below,
their roots meet under water and
sway down stream, forming a slippery
steep down which the amber yellow
water, singing a happy little song to itself,
coasts into the amber black depths
of the pool. Black alders stand cooling<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</span>
their feet all about the edge.
Crowding them into the water are the
great oaks and maples whose limbs
yearn above the pool till they shut out
the sun. Along one side the current
has cut deep to the rough rocks and
the water flows black and swift. On
the other the back-wash circles leisurely
and the bottom shallows to a bank of
sand where the sunfish build their nests
and the fresh-water clams burrow and
put up suppliant mouths to the food-bearing
current. Inshore it lifts to a
sand bar, where you may stand and
swing your pole without interference
from the surrounding trees.</p>

<p>All day long the brook sings itself to
sleep as it slips down the slide into the
slumberous depths of the pool. All day
long the vivid green dragon-flies flutter
by with vivid black wings to bring<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</span>
luck to your fishing, and the red-eyed
vireo pipes his sleepy note in the trees
above. And all day long you shall catch
fish if you will but bait your hook and
drop it in. First you will thin out the
sunfish, for they are the most alert and
gamy of all. Talk about trout! You
should try landing a half-pound sunfish
on a gossamer tackle and a very slender
pole. The sunfish is the <i>Lepomis gibbosus</i>
of the ichthyologists and is a close
relative of the rock bass, and just as
game. He has been irreverently dubbed
&#8220;pumpkin seed&#8221; in some places, from
his shape, which is that of a pumpkin
seed set up on edge. Here in eastern
Massachusetts he is just plain &#8220;kiver,&#8221;
which is the old-time uneducated New
Englander&#8217;s pronunciation of the word
&#8220;cover,&#8221; given him, no doubt, because
he is round and flat. He is as freckled
as a street urchin and as lively. He
has business with your bait the moment
it drops near him, and the bobbing cork
will show that it is he by the jaunty
vigor of its bobs.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i096.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">The way of the &#8220;kiver&#8221; is this. There is a single, snappy, business-like<br />
bob, then another, then three in quick succession</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</span>In fact, if you have learned the ways
of the down-stream country you will
know every fish that takes your bait
long before you have brought him to
the surface from the amber depths, just
by the way in which he bobs that floating
cork. The way of the &#8220;kiver&#8221; is
this. There is a single, snappy, business-like
bob, then another, then three
in quick succession in which he drags
the cork half under. If you strike just
at the right time during the succession
of three, when the line below is taut
with the strain of the float against the
pull of the fish, you shall have him.
Otherwise your cork will lift from the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</span>
water with a humorous snort and you
will hear little trills of derisive laughter
in the song of the stream cascading
down the willow root chute. It will be
safer not to try him on the three bobs,
but wait till the cork begins to bore
into the water and glide off across
stream, showing that the sunfish has
made up his mind that it is a worm, a
good one, and one that he really wants.</p>

<p>The mother sunfish just at this time
of year has her nest in the sand at the
upper end of the bar, in shallow water.
It is a circular depression which she
has scooped out and from which she
has carefully removed all pebbles and
sticks. Here she has laid her eggs, and
here, day and night, she stands guard
over them. If any other fish comes
along, even of her own kind, she will
chase it away with a brustling courage<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</span>
which is like that of a mother hen defending
her chicks. So, after you have
caught the freelance sunfish of the
pool, those which have no family
cares, do not drop your bait near her
nest, for if you do she will dart out and
take it, and it is a pity to have the
brook lose her. She has made her nest
in the one shallow spot where the
bright sunlight plays, and you may
see every dapple of her lovely sides as
the light glances on them. Her every
fin quivers as she floats there, slowly
turning from side to side, her bright
eyes roving in search of enemies to her
offspring. She is a whole torpedo boat
of mother love and pent-up energy, and
so let us leave her, for she makes the
whole pool seem homelike and hospitable.</p>

<p>The yellow perch will come next to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</span>
your hook, his tawny yellow sides
marked by bands of dark green, his
back a darker green yet, and his fins a
rich red. He is the aristocrat of the
pool, his family being one of the very
oldest in the fish domesday book. He
lies in deeper water than the sunfish,
and his bite varies from a gentle nibble
to a good strong succession of pulls
which finally end in the cork going
down out of sight altogether. Yet
when he is at the bait you shall not
mistake any motion of that bob for the
ones made by the sunfish. The perch
has a daintier, more gentlemanly touch.
It is sure and strong, but it lacks the
roistering vitality of the sunfish. It is
an aristocratic bite, and you will recognize
it as such without clearly knowing
why,&mdash;which is proof of his aristocracy.
You will recognize it, too, from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</span>
the elegance of his figure and the
chaste beauty of his attire. He gleams
in the sunlight. His yellow and green
markings are as vivid as those of the
sunfish, yet arranged in exquisite taste,
and he is dapper where the other is
bourgeois.</p>

<p>Sink a little deeper now, for it is
time you caught horn-pouts. The horn-pout
is also &#8220;bull-head,&#8221; and, irreverently
I fear, &#8220;minister,&#8221; because of the
severity of his black attire, which is relieved
only by a white vest. But horn-pout
is the best name, for his horns
stick out fierce and straight from either
side of his gills like the waxed mustachios
of a stage Frenchman. They
are sharp as needles and set as firm as
daggers in their sockets. When you
outrage the dignity of a horn-pout by
pulling him out of the water he waggles<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</span>
these fins of dagger-bone and
makes a peculiar grumbling sound with
them. It is as if he said, &#8220;What!
what! What&#8217;s all this? Who dares
disturb my comfort?&#8221; Then when you
reach to take him off the hook he flips
that nimble black tail of his and jabs his
dagger into your hand. It makes an ugly
wound, and the boys claim that it conceals
venom; a sort of poisoned dagger.
The horn-pout bobs your floating
cork usually twice or three times, a
very different bob from either that of
the sunfish or the yellow perch. It is a
steady, solid down pull each time, taking
the cork half under water. Then he
takes hold in earnest, and the float goes
steadily down and out, as if this were a
matter of no child&#8217;s play, but meaning
something that is solid and substantial
on the other end of the line. Oftentimes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</span>
this is true indeed, for the black-coated
one may weigh a pound or two
and double your birch rod into a good
half-circle before he lets go his grip on
the water.</p>

<p>When you get down to the horn-pouts
you have fishing indeed, but all
the time the climax of your day&#8217;s career
is lurking down in the cavernous depths
where the stream has gullied far beneath
the ledge, for there, as thick as
your wrist and three feet long, weighing
a pound to the foot of solid white flesh
and muscle, is an eel.</p>

<p>The eel is the strange misanthrope of
the brooks and fresh-water ponds. You
may peer into the sunlit shallows and
see the other fishes at their work or
play. They are companionable. If
you will live on the pond edge you may
train the minnows, the sunfish, the yellow<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</span>
perch even, to come up and eat out
of your hand. I have watched a big
horn-pout lumbering about in the shady
depths for an hour and seen him carefully
inspect a hookless worm which I
had dropped to him, before he ate it,
noting with glee the gravity and self-importance
with which he finally decided
that it was all right and that he would
confer a favor upon it by swallowing it
whole. Yet never once have I seen or
laid hands on an eel in fresh water.
There he goes his own mysterious way
among the rock crevices and along the
mud of the ultimate depths. The other
fishes of the brook travel in schools; he
goes alone. They were spawned up
stream; he was born on the sands of
the fishing banks, a hundred miles off
shore. He came up stream as a young
eel squirming through dams that shut<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</span>
out other fishes. When the time comes
for him to go back he will go back the
same way, waxed fat indeed, but still
unseen, devious, self-possessed, and uncannily
shrewd.</p>

<p>That he may live to go back he inspects
carefully the worms which may
drop into the cool shadows where he
lurks. When he is about to take your
bait you need to be keen to know what
is going on, for he suspects you, and
your least untoward motion of rod or
line will cause him to slip back like a
shadow into his cavern, and there will
be no bite from him on that hook after
that. You will say that it cannot possibly
be a bite; the bob simply stops and
the hook has no doubt caught on a snag
on bottom. If you are not wise enough
to know better you will pull up here lest
you lose your hook, and in so doing you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</span>
will lose your eel, for he is simply testing
you. He has hold of the very bottom
of that hook, below point and barb, and
if you pull you pull it out of his mouth
without hooking him. Then in cynical
glee he&#8217;ll wag himself deeper into his
cavern beneath the stones, and that is
the last of him. You may fish the pool
for a week before he will forget his
caution and try another angle-worm. If,
however, nothing rouses his suspicions
the bob will gradually sink lower till it
is more than half submerged, hang there
for a little, give another sag downward,
and so by degrees be drawn cautiously
under. Your eel is cannily carrying the
hook down into his cavern, where he
may finish his meal at leisure. Now is
the crucial moment. He must not be allowed
to get in among the stones, for
even if your strike hooks him he will<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</span>
twist himself desperately around them
and then twist the hook out. A steady
quick pull and you feel him on. Then
indeed you &#8220;give him the butt,&#8221; as the
fly fishermen say gloryingly. Your lithe
birch rod bends in your hands till the tip
is near your wrist as you lean desperately
back with all your strength. The
hold of a three-foot eel on the water is
tremendous. Until he tires a bit it is
almost as good as yours on the birch
pole, but steadily, inch by inch, you draw
him away out into the pool, where the
fight is a fair one. Now his head is
above water and his great lithe body
whirls like a propeller beneath. Again
look out; for when he leaves the water
it will be as if he shot out, and you
are liable to go with him, backward into
the bushes, where he will tie your line
into ten thousand knots, break out the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</span>
hook, and run for the brook as a snake
might.</p>

<p>At the moment he leaves the surface
you slow up. Up into the air he shoots
and drops till his tail welts the ground
at your feet. Here let him wriggle at
the end of the taut line while you break
a stout alder switch with one hand, and
as you drop him to earth belabor him
with it. This will stun him quicker than
anything else, and you may then deal
with him as you will, only be quick
about it, for he is very tenacious of
life.</p>

<p>Then, if you are a true fisherman, you
will wind up what line is left you and
go your way, for the pool has no more
foemen worthy of your steel. There will
be but one eel to a pool, and to go on
catching sunfish would be insipid indeed.</p>

</div>


<p><span class="xlarge">B</span>ROOK magic does not begin until
you have passed the deep fishing-pool
and traversed the reedy meadow where
the flagroot loves to go swimming and
the muskrats come to spice their midnight
lunches with its pungent root and
pile the broad flags for winter nests.
You may, if you are alert, feel a touch
of its witchery as you wind among the
rocks and black alders of the level
swamp beyond, for here the ostrich-feather
fern lifts its regal plumes as
high as your head, and if by any chance
you duck under these you have been
near the portals of a world where sorcery
is rife, for fern seed has a mysterious
power of its own, and the ferns of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</span>
the alder swamp are decorations on the
road to the realm of the witch-hazel,
where all sorts of strange things may
come to pass.</p>

<p>The ferns and the witch-hazel are
themselves mysterious and promoters of
mystery, and it is hard to tell which
leads in waywardness and subornation
of sorcery. The ferns are the lingering
representatives of an elder world,&mdash;a
world that was old before the first pine
dropped its cones or the leaves of the
first deciduous tree fell on the first
greensward. Their ways are not the
ways of modern plant life.</p>

<p>Take the cinnamon fern, for instance,
one of the commonest of our woods. It
grows up each spring like a tender and
succulent herb, to wither and die down
in the fall as the grass does. But take
a spade into the woods with you and try<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</span>
to transplant a good-sized cinnamon fern.
You will fail, unless you have brought
an axe along too, for the seemingly
herbaceous plant has an underground
trunk, sometimes two or three feet in
diameter, almost as solid and firm in
texture as that of a tree.</p>

<p>The fern shows no blossom to the
world of butterfly or moth, no fruit for
the delectation of fox or field mouse.
The curious little dots growing along the
margins of the leaves, which we call
&#8220;fern seed&#8221; by courtesy, grow no fern
when planted. They simply grow a little
primitive leaf form which curiously imitates
a blossom in its functions and
produces a new fern.</p>

<p>But the witch-hazel is stranger yet in
its ways. In the spring, when it should
by all tokens of the plant world be putting
out blossoms, it is busy growing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</span>
nuts which are the product of last
year&#8217;s blossoms. Then in the late autumn,
even November, you will find it
in bloom, twisting yellow petal fingers
in mourning at the fall of its own
leaves.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i114.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">That such things are not seen oftener is simply because people<br />
are dull and go to bed instead of sitting out under the<br />
witch-hazel at midnight of a full moon</p>

<p>Pluck one of the nuts of a midsummer
evening and look it intently in the
face. Note the little shrewd pig eyes of
the witch far ingrown in it, the funny
shrewish tip-tilted nose, the puffy cheeks
and eyelids. See that slender horn in
the forehead, the sure mark of the
witch. No wonder that it has the name
witch-hazel with such ways and such
faces growing all over it at a time
when most other trees and shrubs have
but finished blossoming. But if you
want further proof that this shrub harbors
witches you need but to examine
its oval, wavy-toothed leaves just at this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</span>
time of the year and see the little conical
red witch-caps hung on them. There
need be but little doubt that, sitting
under it at midnight of a full moon,
you may see the witch faces detach
themselves from the limbs, put on these
red caps and sail off across the great
yellow disk. That such things are not
seen oftener is simply because people are
dull and go to bed instead of sitting
out under the witch-hazel at midnight
of a full moon.</p>

<p>To be sure there are scientific men,
gray-bearded entomologists, who will tell
us that these little red caps are galls,
the rearing-place of plant aphids, caused
by the laying of the mother insect&#8217;s egg
within the tissue of the leaf, but one
might as well believe that the witches
hang their hats on the witch-hazel over
night as to believe that the laying of a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</span>
minute egg in the tissue of a leaf could
cause the plant to grow a witch hat.</p>

<p>No doubt these same wise men would
explain to you that it is not possible to
become invisible by sprinkling fern seed
on your head during the dark of the
moon and saying the right words, but
did one of them ever try it?</p>

<p>It is appropriate that the witch-hazel
should shade the portals through which
the brook enters the glen at the foot of
the pasture, for the path here enters
you into a world of witchery where the
glamour of the place will hold you long
of a summer afternoon.</p>

<p>At the foot of the glen an ancient
mill-dam once blocked the free passage
of the water and a mill-wheel vexed its
current. Now only the rude embankment
remains with half-century old hickories
and maples growing on it, arching<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</span>
in and shading the glen with their imbricated
branches. No rust of mill-wheel,
no trace of building remains, and
the very tradition of the mill and its
owners is gone. No one to-day knows
whether it ground corn or sawed boards
for the pioneer who built it, who laid the
sill of its dam so firm and level that the
wear of two centuries of swift water
has not entirely obliterated it. At the
very bottom of the glen it forms a shallow
pool where brook magic and witch-hazel
glamour shall show you many
midsummer fantasies if you will but
look for them.</p>

<p>It was in the glen that I found the
first real relief from the heat of midday.
The grasses of the sun-parched pasture
had crisped under foot and broken off,
so dry were they, all the way down to
the sweet-flag meadow. Here the brook<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</span>
water keeps all growing things lush and
green, but the glare of the sun is only
the more intense. It follows you into
the alder swamp, and you may sit under
the arching fronds of the ostrich-plume
ferns in vain.</p>

<p>But after you have scrambled through
them and ducked under the mock benediction
of the witch-hazel limbs that
stretch above your head while the witch-hazel
faces grin a cynical &#8220;Bless you,
my child,&#8221; you feel that you are willing
to take your chances with swamp witchery
and brook magic. For in the glen
cool waters crisp over cold stones and
the breeze sighs up stream and fans
you as you sit on the brink of the pool
and lean your head against the ledge
from whose crannies drip the fairy
fronds of the rock fern.</p>

<p>These are but little fellows of our<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</span>
fern world, and the magic which distills
from their fern seed is no doubt less
potent than that from greater ferns, but
added to the witch-hazel glamour it
makes brook magic which will initiate
you into many mysteries of the pasture
world if you are but patient. Sitting
there with the tiny brown spores of the
rock fern dripping upon your shoulders
with infinitesimal rattle, you seem to see
more clearly the glen life and to know
the meaning of many sounds hitherto
only half understood.</p>

<p>Always there is the sleepy song which
the brook sings to itself in summer,&mdash;a
song to which the warble of the vireo
in the overhead leafage adds but a
dreamy staccato. But if you listen
through this you shall presently hear
the water goblins grumbling to themselves
in their abodes under flat stones.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</span>
They are old and grumpy, these water
goblins, and they never cease to mumble
to themselves about their troubles.</p>

<p>Very likely they complain incessantly
because they are hungry and the supply
of demoiselle nymphs is running short.
There are plenty of demoiselles, flitting
back and forth across the pools on glittering
black wings, which they fold
closely to their iridescent green bodies
when they light. They are such ladylike
dragon-flies that it is no wonder
that the name &#8220;demoiselle,&#8221; which
French scientists with admirable gallantry
have given them, has stuck. With
all their ladylike short and modest flights
and the saintly way in which they fold
their wings when they light on some
leaf beside the pool, a folding as of
hands in prayer, the demoiselles are
dragon-flies, and each prayer may well<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</span>
be for the soul of some midge or
other wee insect captured in the short
flight.</p>

<p>The true dragon-fly&mdash;the one which
rests with wings widespread&mdash;hunts like
a hawk, but the demoiselles seem to take
their prey with a gentle grace and charm
of manner which ought to make the
midge&#8217;s last moments his happiest ones.
I always suspect them of folding him
in a perfumed napkin and eating him
with salad dressing and a spoon after
they get back to their boudoir, but I
cannot prove this any more than I can
that it is really a water goblin that
grumbles under the flat stone.</p>

<p>Many a time I have turned the stones
over suddenly, but I never yet was quick
enough to surprise the goblin. I have
found him there, mind you, but never
in his true shape. Always he has managed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</span>
to transform himself into something
different,&mdash;perhaps into a spotted turtle
or a grouchy horn-pout. I have even
known him to turn into an ugly, many-legged
helgramite worm, not having time
to make the more reputable transformation.
It is hard to catch a grumbling
goblin asleep, especially in a pool below
the witch-hazels, where the brook magic
is strong.</p>

<p>It is easier to see the demoiselle
nymphs. They are not very beautiful
or seemingly very savory, and if the
water goblins do eat them it is no wonder
they grumble. You may have seen
a hawk-like dragon-fly skimming about
over an open pool dip in swallow fashion
to the surface. These sudden and repeated
dips are not for a bath nor yet
for a drink. What you see is a female
dragon-fly laying eggs which shall later<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</span>
hatch and become under-water nymphs,
the larv&aelig; of the dragon-fly. But the
demoiselles, still rightly named, do nothing
so brazen as that. Instead, they
pick out some nodding water weed, fold
their wings a little more tightly to their
iridescent bodies and crawl down it into
the water. Here, in proper seclusion
beneath the surface, they pierce the
reed&#8217;s stem with keen ovipositor and lay
their eggs. Then they saunter forth
again and discreetly eat more midges
with salad dressing and a spoon.</p>

<p>If you look closely among the water
weeds in the transparent water at the
pool margin you may see the demoiselle
nymphs crawling about, breathing
through feathers in their tails, and
scooping up food with a big shovel
which sticks out under their chins. They
show little traces of their coming beauty.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</span>
It is the awkward age of the demoiselle,
and I fancy each is right glad to do up
the hair, get into long black skirts with
iridescent green bodices, and join the
afternoon tea flitters.</p>

<p>What the magic is in the brook,
whereby these strange, awkward, crawling
creatures, living beneath the water,
some day crawl up the stem of a water
weed, burst, stretch their wings and fly
away the saintly and demure demoiselles
of the pool, I do not know&mdash;whether it
be distilled from the witch-hazel by the
summer sun, or whether it slips more
mysteriously from beneath the breast-plate
of the spore of the polypody
growing just above my head in the rock
crevice. It must be the same magic
whereby the many-legged, crawling helgramite
worm, after living that sort of
life sometimes for several years, one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</span>
day crawls ashore, goes to sleep beneath
a stone, and in another month wakes up
and finds himself a <i>Corydalus cornutus</i>, a
three-inch-long bug with extraordinary
wings and great horns,&mdash;a bug that
might well make one of those witches,
met face to face on the moon&#8217;s disk,
shriek and fall off her broomstick. If
he can be that thing, changed from a
helgramite worm, why can he not be
a helgramite worm, changed from the
water goblin which you can hear grumbling
beneath the flat stone at the entrance
to the pool beneath the witch-hazels?</p>

<p>The answer is to be found neither in
the rhyme of the poet nor in the reason
of the scientific man.</p>

<p>Musing on these things I suddenly sat
up from my quiet seat beneath the rock
ferns, for more magic yet was being displayed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</span>
before my eyes. Over on the
further side, in the shallow eddy, the
pool was troubled a second, then there
rose from it a wee sunfish, not more
than three inches long, rose from it tail
first and began balancing across the pool
surface toward me, on his head. His
tail quivered in the air, and I could see
his freckles growing in the yellow transparency
of his skin, yet, though I watched
with wide eyes, he was two-thirds the
way across the pool toward me before I
noticed beneath him the tip of the nose
and the wicked little dark eye of a water
snake. At sight of him the demoiselles
should have shrieked and flown away,
but they made no move. I, however,
indignant, arose, and seizing broken
fragments of rock was about to lacerate
him and loose his prey when I quite
suddenly thought better of it. Had not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</span>
I a few days before come down stream
to the deep pool above and carried off a
string of perch, sunfish, pouts, and an
eel? Had not the water snake also a
right to his dinner?</p>

<p>I dropped my rock fragments, but
there was no longer pleasure in waiting
to woo the demure coquetry of the demoiselles.
The serpent had entered Eden
and the man was driven forth. I lingered
only long enough to see the grace
and strength of the snake as he glided
over the sill of the old dam, now black
and sinuous, now giving me a glimpse
of the vivid red of the under parts of
his body, but always keeping his grip
secure on the little sunfish whom he
was taking away to luncheon with
him.</p>

<p>I climbed out of the glen, glad to go
for once, but at the top of the rock<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</span>
where the sunburnt pasture path begins
again I was in for another shudder, for
here the dragon had entered fairy land.
He came, writhing his horrid length
along the path, his scales shining in the
sun, his great mouth gaping, and up near
his abnormally great head two little impotent
forelegs wriggling. Who wouldn&#8217;t
turn and run before such a creature as
this? To be sure he was scarce three
feet long, and his curiously mottled-brown
back was that of the common
adder, one of our harmless snakes, though
he looks ugly enough to be stuffed with
venom. But this great gaping head
and the wriggling forelegs; never did
flat-head adder have such a front as
this!</p>

<p>My compassion for snakes that had a
right to their dinner vanished before this
creature. It is different when it seems<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</span>
as if you might be the dinner. Those
forelegs beckoned, and how could I tell
but, in this land of witch-hazel, fern
seed, and brook magic, I might not
shrink sufficiently to be taken in by that
huge mouth in that misapplied head?
Death were better,&mdash;that is, death for
the dragon,&mdash;and I caught up a jagged
piece of the top of the glen and hurled
it at him. It struck the beast fair amidships.
The dragon whirled and writhed
for a second or two and lay motionless,
and behold! the head separated from the
body and began to limp away. Then
first was the spell broken and I saw
clearly. It was simply a flat-head adder
that had taken a good-sized garden toad
for his dinner, had swallowed him whole
as far as the forelegs, but failed to engulf
these. It was the combination
which made the dragon.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</span>Somehow I haven&#8217;t cared for the glen
since. The early glamour of brook
magic is pleasant, but I fear that, like
the hasheesh of the Orient, its end is
very bad dreams.</p>

<p class="ph1">IN THE PONKAPOAG BOGS</p>
</div>


<p><span class="xlarge">I</span> DO not find in all my wanderings,
afield or afloat, a more quaintly delightful
plant than the floating-heart. In my
pasture world it grows in one place only,&mdash;along
the shallow edges of the bogs
of Ponkapoag Pond. I think no other
pond or stream in this immediate region
has it, and so sweetly shy is it that you
may pass it year after year without noting
its existence. It waits until the
summer has marked its meridian before
it ventures to send up its dainty little
<i>cr&ecirc;pe de chine</i> petals, each fairy-like
bloom appearing for one day only in the
very throb of the mottled olive and
bronze heart, which is a leaf. The leaf
itself is barely an inch across, the exquisite<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</span>
bloom less than half that; yet
once you know it you love it beyond all
other bog plants as being the most fairy-like
of water-lilies, though it is not a
water-lily at all when it comes to botanical
classification, being of the gentian
family.</p>

<p>However, not to be a water-lily is not
so bad if one may be classed with the
fringed and closed gentians which are to
bloom later on the landward edges of the
bog. As the little blossom fades at
nightfall, its short stalk curls back beneath
the water to ripen the seeds there,
hung just beneath the leaf from a peculiar
bulb-like nodule just an inch or so
down on the petiole. The next morning
another wee white bud shoots up in the
heart angle of the leaf and opens fragile
petals in the sun.</p>

<p>I recall no other plant that sends up<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</span>
blooms from the leaf stalk in this way.
When the seeds have ripened I suspect
the plant of setting this bulb-like nodule
free to float away to another shore, take
root as a real corm or tuber might, and
produce more floating-hearts.</p>

<p>This bog on the westerly shore of
Ponkapoag Pond was not long ago made
a part of Boston&#8217;s park system, which
thus moves ever sedately toward the
Berkshire hills, yet it is a bit of nature
as wild and untrammeled as it was in
the days when Myles Standish may have
looked down upon it from the top of
great Blue Hill, as it had stood unchanged
in his day for many and many a long
century. So I fancy it will remain for
centuries to come, for Nature holds her
own here well. Indeed, she encroaches,
for a bog grows wherever it has free
water to grow into. So, after many<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</span>
centuries, frequenters of the Blue Hill
Reservation will note a broad expanse
of swamp land where once sparkled the
waters of this hundred-acre pond. For
the way of the bog is this.</p>

<p>All along its under-water front the
obscure under-water weeds grow up and
die year after year, generation after
generation, forming fertile banks of
beautiful soft mud, into whose lower
depths the great thick rootstocks of the
pond-lilies push, and in which the fibrous
roots of the tape grass, the fresh-water
eel grass, find a hold. The growth and
decay of these, with the water shield,
with its jelly-protected foliage, the yellow
dog-lily, and in lesser depths the
bulrush, add to the growing bank as
coral insects grow and die in tropic seas,
until it is near enough to the surface
for the pickerel weed to find roothold.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</span>
Then indeed the bog steps forward with
vigor, for the pickerel weed is its firing
line. All summer you shall see its blue
banners flaunting gayly in the southern
breezes, tempting the land-loving bumble-bee
to sea, calling the honey-bee from
the mile-distant hive, and offering rest
and luncheon to a myriad lesser insects,
all with genial hospitality. Its serried
millions in close ranks breast the waves
in a broad blue line from one end of the
bog to the other, a half-mile or so.</p>

<p>Behind these are shallow pools, where
again you find the white water-lilies.
Here they bloom in enormous profusion
from late June until early September,
reaching their grand climax during late
July. On such a day, standing in the
boat at the southerly end of the bog,
counting those within a given space and
multiplying, I estimated that there were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</span>
ten thousand of the fragrant white blooms
in sight. Twice as many more were
hidden by bulrush and pickerel weed.
On Sundays and holidays boatloads of
trolley trippers paddle and push among
them and carry them off by the hundred,
yet they make no mark on the visible
supply. The decay of the leaves and
stems of these add to the under-water
foothold of the bog, but after all it must
be the reedy stems, sagittate leaves, and
interwoven roots of the pickerel weed
that are its main foundation.</p>

<p>Steadily seaward over the foundation
thus laid progresses the long, definite
front of the saw-edged marsh grass.
Once it interlocks its roots along the
mud surface formed for it, it leaves no
room for the freer-growing denizens of
the shallows. In among the marsh grass
grows no flaunting flag of pickerel weed,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</span>
no pure white nymph&aelig;a sends forth its
rich odor.</p>

<p>Only the bog cranberry may hold its
own in any quantity against the throttling
squeeze of those grass roots. Where
these grow is the high sea of the bog,
its waves rising and falling in the free
winds. Yet, just as pickerel weed and
water-lily give way before the advance
of the marsh grass, so it in turn falls
on the landward side before the advancing
hosts of the swamp.</p>

<p>A steady phalanx of swamp cedars
pushes its foothold farther and farther
out upon it, year by year, scouting with
button bush and black alder and holding
every inch that they obtain for it. Now
and then something happens to a brief
area of marsh grass and cranberries so
that their dense packed minions faint
and release their root grip on the quaking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</span>
mud. Every such opening is seized
by the alder or the button bush, and the
cedars follow them; indeed, sometimes
the cedars, favored by the right wind or
the right bird carriers at seeding time,
slip in first, and little island clumps of
their dark bronze green stand here and
there over against the cadet blue of Blue
Hill which hangs like a beautiful drop-curtain
always on the westerly sky.</p>

<p>Once, a half-century ago or more, a
farmer and his men came down from
the pastures, and for purposes of their
own cut a ditch straight through the
middle of the bog to the open water.
The hundreds of scrawny night herons,
sitting on pale blue eggs in scraggly nests
in the cedar swamp must have heard the
cedars laugh as this went on. It was
the swamp&#8217;s opportunity. Where the
farmer and his men with incredible<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</span>
labor cut and tore away the marsh-grass
roots the cedars planted their
seeds, and called upon the alders and the
swamp maples and the thoroughwort, the
Joe Pye weed, and a host of other good
citizens of the swamp, to help them.</p>

<p>So vigorous was the sortie and so
well did they hold their ground that you
may trace the farmer&#8217;s wide ditch to-day
only as a causeway down which the
swamp has come to build a great
wooded area in the midst of the bog,
accomplishing in half a century what it
might not have done in five times that
had it not been for human aid. Thus,
slowly as you and I count time, only an
inch or two a year perhaps, yet all too
rapidly for the joy of future generations,
the bog encroaches upon the pond
and the swamp follows towards complete
possession, which as the centuries<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</span>
go by will make the quaking sphagnum
firm meadow land.</p>

<p>For all you and I know, the Metropolitan
Park Commission of the year
3908 will be fixing up a second Franklin
Field here for the camping ground
of visiting Pythians. Meanwhile let us
hasten to enjoy our bog and its reedy
borders.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i142.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">Of a clear midsummer evening you may hear the muskrat<br />
grubbing roots there ... and hear his snort and splash<br />
when he dives at sudden sight of you</p>

<p>It is the home and the occasional resting
place of many a wild free creature.
Of a clear midsummer evening you may
hear the muskrat grubbing roots there,
see, perhaps, the moonlight glint on the
long V-shaped ripple which he makes as
he swims, and hear his snort and splash
when he dives at sudden sight of you.
You may chance upon a disconsolate
bittern sitting clumsily in dumpy patience
as he waits for food to splash
up to him, and you may even hear him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</span>
work his wheezy, dislocated wooden
pump, a cry as awkward and disconsolate
as the bird.</p>

<p>The muskrats breed in the bog, the
bittern had his grassy nest there, and a
myriad blackbirds have made the low
bushes vocal with their cheery whistles
all summer. They are flocking now,
getting the young birds in training for
the long flight south, but they still hang
about the bog and they still whistle
merrily. Surely it is not environment
that makes temperament. Bittern and
blackbird both frequent bogs, yet the
bittern is a lonely misanthrope, whom I
more than half suspect of being melancholy
mad, while the blackbird is as
cheery and as fond of his fellows as a
candidate. When you hear his whistle
you half expect him to light on a
thwart, hand you a cigar, and ask after<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</span>
the baby. But the blackbird&#8217;s election
is sure anyway.</p>

<p>Another loved and lovely denizen of
these bogs is the wood duck. These
breed in the swamp, the mother bird
building a grassy nest in a hollow tree,
where she lays from eight to fourteen
buff-white eggs, and leads her yellow
fluffy ducklings to a nearby secluded
pool for their first swim. Later they
come out into the bog, and ultimately
make the pond, where they learn to forage
for themselves. By the first of
August the mother bird has sent them
adrift, in the main, to paddle and flap
their way about as best they may. They
are &#8220;flappers,&#8221; as the boys call them.
That is, they can make good speed along
the surface by half running and flapping
vigorously, but they cannot yet fly
enough to rise into the air.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</span>One of these young wood ducks came
out of the bog the other morning, just
at the gray of dawn, and swam over
toward the boat landing. He was quite
near the shore when I took ship and
rowed to seaward of him, thus shutting
him off from the open pond and from
the bog. Then for an hour or two followed
what was to me the most interesting
duck hunting I have done for a
long time. I could row as fast as he
could swim, and I continually edged him
along the south shore, getting nearer
every minute. I have read much of the
marvelous intelligence of wild creatures.
Yet I saw little of it in this
chase. The duck knew me for an
enemy, on general principles, for I was a
man, and I was evidently coming after
him. Even rudimentary intelligence
should have told him to flap for the bog<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</span>
as fast as he could. He did nothing of
the sort. He just edged along down the
shore, evidently hoping that I was light-minded,
and would forget all about him
in a minute or two if let alone. But I
kept at it until I was so near I could see
every one of his already handsome
feathers and note the coloring of those
parts which had not yet reached the
beauty of maturity. I could see the yellow
rim of his eye, and still he swam
east and swam west but made no real
move to escape.</p>

<p>Two things I wished to learn from
my wood duck. One was how much
general intelligence and real quickness
of wit he would show in escaping. The
other was how he carried his wings under
water if, by any fortunate chance, I
should be able to see him swim after he
went down to escape me. But at first<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</span>
he was so irresolute that he neither
dived nor made any vigorous attempt to
escape. I got so near, that to avoid
driving him up the bank into the woods
I had to ease away a bit. Finally, at my
second approach, he did try to flap by
the end of the boat, but I spurted and
headed him off.</p>

<p>It was a long time, and it took much
man&#339;uvring to make him dive, but it
finally entered his head that he might
avoid being cornered and badgered by
going under water. This he did, going
on a slant just a very little below the
surface, probably because he was in too
shallow water to go much deeper, and
coming up well to seaward. There he
preened his feathers, took a sip or two
of water and, seemingly, waited to be
surrounded a second time.</p>

<p>I rowed out, got on the off-shore side<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</span>
of him, and again began boating him in
toward the shore. He showed less uneasiness
this time, but dived and swam
out again after considerable more pressing.
Again and again I repeated this,
sometimes getting no sight of him under
water, again seeing him move along
very plainly. At no time did I notice
any motion of the wings under water.
I have been told that wild ducks when
swimming beneath the surface make
most of their progress with their wings,
quite literally flying under water. This
may be, but I have no evidence of it in
the under-water action of this one.</p>

<p>Again, it has been sagely impressed
upon me by old duck hunters that you
could tell in what direction from your
boat a bird would rise by noting the
way in which his bill pointed when he
went under. I think it was Adirondack<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</span>
Murray in that famous loon-hunting chapter
who first made the point, and it has
been insisted upon by many another successor.
But, bless you, my half-grown
wood duck made no difficulty of going
down with his head toward the morning
and coming up in the sunset portion of
the view. He took slants under water
and cut semicircles at will. But I
couldn&#8217;t see him use his wings while
beneath the wave.</p>

<p>Little by little he got over being excited
by my presence. He began to eat
bugs off the lily pads as he went by, and
now and then tip up for an under-water
search. Thus we coquetted with one
another all along the southern shore of
the pond, and when I finally cornered
him for a last time in behind Loon
Island he dove without embarrassment
and began his feeding as soon as he had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</span>
again reached the surface. The chase
was no longer exciting, and I turned my
attention to something else. Then he
swam out quite a little further into the
pond, preened his feathers carefully,
tucked his head under his wing and
went to sleep!</p>

<p>Evidently he had decided that I was
eccentric, but harmless, and the best way
to escape my attentions would be to
leave me severely alone.</p>

<p>And there you have it. I think the
wood duck is beautiful, but not very
bright. Yet it occurs to me that some
Sherlock Holmes of the woods may
prove, to the satisfaction of Dr. Watson
anyway, that he is preternaturally
clever, in that this one, though still
young, was keen enough to see that
from the first I had no evil intentions
toward him.</p>

<p><span class="xlarge">A</span>T dusk all the edges of the pond
are lighted with the white candles of
the clethra. Its fragrance has in it that
fine essence which goes to the making
of the nectar and ambrosia of the gods.
He who would sup with them may do
so by taking canoe of an early August
twilight when the purple arras of the
coves glow softly golden with the reflected
light of the sunset&#8217;s afterglow.
Then the coarser air seems to have let
the light slip from between its clumsy
particles, leaving its more ethereal
essence still clinging to a more subtle
interatomic fluid.</p>

<p>The fragrance of the clethra seems
always to me as fine as this spirit of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</span>
light in the ambrosial twilight of the
ripened summer. It is no air-borne delight
like the resinous scent of the forest
pines or the pasture sweet-fern when
the hot sun of midday distills them and
the hot wind of midday sends them far
to you across the quivering fields. It is
something finer, softer, more silkily
subtle, which, like the rose gold of the
afterglow of the sunset, tints the dusk
of the cove between the air atoms, not
by way of them.</p>

<p>Then, as the gold glimmers and fades
and the pink faints in the cooling purple
of the dusk, and the outline of the cove
shore slips from the front of your eye
to the chambers of memory behind it, so
that you else might see it best with the
eyes shut, the white candles are lighted
and the eager moth sees by them to sup
with you and me and the gods on this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</span>
essence of ambrosia, to tipple on this
spirit of nectar which the night reserves
for those that love it.</p>

<p>I do not know why the clethra which
gleams so white in the dusk should
need anything more than its own white
beauty to call the moth to its wooing.
Perhaps it does not need more. Perhaps
all this fine fragrance is but the
overflow of its soul&#8217;s delight at being
young and chastely beautiful, and trembling
in the ultra violet darkness on that
delicious verge of life that waits the
wooer. I half fancy that this is true of
all perfume of flowers, that it is less a
call to butterfly or bee to come to their
winning than it is a radiation of delight
from their own pure hearts at the dawning
of the full joy of living. I am not
always willing to take the word of the
scientific investigator on these points as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</span>
final. The scientists of the not very remote
past have known so much that is
not so!</p>

<p>It is possible that, just as a hunting-dog
picks up a scent that is strong in
his nostrils and has no power in ours,
so the flowers that we call scentless
send out an odor too faintly fine for our
senses, yet one that the antenn&aelig; of
moth or bee may entangle as it passes
and hold for a certain clue. Perhaps
the scents that are only faint to us carry
far for the butterfly, but if so, and if
flower perfumes are made only for the
calling of insects, why need they be made
so intoxicating to the human senses?
The scent of carnations is as pleasing
to the soul as a strain of beautiful
music, and equally arouses high aspirations
and noble longings. So to me the
odor of the clethra at nightfall is a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</span>
tenuous thread of ethereality that
reaches far toward a realm of spiritual
ideals. It ought to go with a ritual and
a vested choir.</p>

<p>I do not find the odor of the pasture
milkweed speaking thus to any inner
sense. It is just a gentle, lovable, stay-at-home
smell that surely does not float
farther than the pasture bars. Yet of
all the plants that have bloomed within
my world of garden and pasture this
summer it has been by far the most
popular among insects. It is not that it
is the most attractive to the eye, in any
of its forms, for there are many flowers
of colors more vivid and to be seen
farther, as well as of much stronger
scent. Yet all day long you will find it
besieged by bees, from the aristocratic
Italian worker from the farmer&#8217;s best
hive down to those scallawag bees that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</span>
make no honey for themselves but lead
a vagabond life and lay their eggs in
other bees&#8217; nests, leaving their young to
grow up in unendowed orphan asylums.</p>

<p>Many varieties of ants seek the milkweed
blooms, and you shall find about a
large clump more sorts of wasps than
you would believe existed, yet it is the
butterflies who most of all make it their
rallying place. Every butterfly in the
whole region makes it his business to
know each large clump of milkweed,
and to make the rounds at least daily.</p>

<p>There, if you watch, you may see
the pretty little pearl crescent, whose
range is from Labrador to Texas. The
shy meadow browns flit out from the
shadow of the brook alders and feed for
a moment before they take fright at the
fact that they are out in society and
flit desperately back again. The angle<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</span>
wings flip about like animated question-marks,
and fulvous fritillaries soar sedately,
now and then lighting to feed
and fold their wings that you may see
the big silver spots of the under parts.
And so you might name them all, almost
every butterfly of early August,
all besieging the milkweed so eagerly
that you may hardly drive them away.</p>

<p>The fact is they come neither for
scent nor sight; they come for good
taste&mdash;which they find in the honey
glands of the peculiarly shaped bloom,
which are obvious and sticky and within
reach of all. I do not think it is half
so much the odor of the flower which
draws them, be it never so sweet or so
strong, but memory of the honey dew
sipped there yesterday or last week.
No doubt the love of the milkweed
bloom is an inherited tendency, also,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</span>
bred in the bones from a line of milkweed-frequenting
ancestors infinitely long.</p>

<p>Indeed, one of our most splendid butterflies
is the <i>Anosia plexippus</i>, otherwise
known as the milkweed butterfly,
rightly named also the monarch. Every
boy who knows the country in summer
knows him by his rich, red coloration,
his strong, black-bordered wings with
their black veins. Every bird knows
him too and lets him alone. On the
first median nervule of the hind wings
of the butterfly is a scent bag whence
he dispenses an odor so disagreeable to
the bird who would eat him that he goes
free, and is not afterward troubled.</p>


<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i160.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">Every boy who knows the country in summer knows him by<br />
his rich, red coloration, his strong, black-bordered wings<br />
with their black veins</p>


<p>Along with the monarch sipping
honey with eager industry from the
meadow milkweed, you will often see
the viceroy, who, as a viceroy should,
closely imitates, but does not equal, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</span>
monarch. He has neither the monarch&#8217;s
vigor of flight nor his means of
defence from predatory birds, but his
safety&mdash;so the students tell us&mdash;lies
in looking so much like his superior
that he also is let alone. The students
go on to say that his is a good example
of the imitative power of insects whereby
they escape destruction by seeming
to the casual eye to be something else.</p>

<p>The viceroy, which is a <i>Basilarchia
disippus</i>, thus looks not the least like
other members of his family, but consciously
mimics the coloring of the
monarch for safety. Thus many tropical
beetles contrive to look like wasps
that they may not be molested, and
some insects look like brown leaves and
others like green ones.</p>

<p>But do they contrive, imitate, mimic?
It is no doubt true that because of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</span>
resemblance they escape, but to say that
they imitate or contrive or mimic seems
to me to be to assume a knowledge of
the workings of the inner consciousness
of an insect that not even the most careful
student can have. I am more inclined
to believe that the so-called
mimics are fortunate in an accidental
resemblance and so escape the destruction
of their species which has fallen
upon many a less fortunate type.</p>

<p>Yet no butterfly, however exquisite
his coloring, or however strong and
graceful his flight, twangs with his
fluttering wings the fine heartstrings of
romance as does the monarch. The
first one that came dancing down the
sunlight to the sweet rocket in bloom in
my garden this spring brought to me a
spicy odor of tropic isles. The beating
of his wings shed, as he passed, faint<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</span>
fragrance of Mexican jasmine, and I
thought I saw slip from them the infinitesimal
dust of the pollen of stephanotis
lately blooming in the glades of
Panama. Three months before he
floated serenely beneath my cherry tree
he may well have soared through the
tropic glades where crumble the ruins
of the palaces of the Incas.</p>

<p>His flight, seemingly as frail as that
of a red autumn leaf sliding down the
October zephyr to carpet the nearby
field with rustling fragrance, has
matched that of that rifle-ball of bird
life, the ruby-throated humming-bird.
Together they sip the sweets of my
sweet rocket in the spring. Together
they wing their way south to the region
of perpetual summer when the winds of
late September promise frost. Sometimes
in this annual flight the monarchs<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</span>
pass the sandy stretches of the New Jersey
coast in swarms that, stopping at
nightfall for rest, refoliate with their
folded wings the shrubs left bare by the
autumn gales.</p>

<p>It may be that, like the birds, the
knowledge of the route they must follow
is bred in the marrow of their butterfly
bones by the constant use of a
million generations. It may be that
they simply drift away from the cool
wind from the North toward the Southern
sun that shines so serenely in the bright
autumn days. But whether through
the guiding hand of Providence, or inherited
wisdom, or a fortunate tact that
acting from day to day produces the
happy result, this Southern movement
in winter is the sole salvation of the
species here in the North.</p>

<p>If they did not make these long<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</span>
flights we should have no Anosias with
us each summer, for unlike other butterflies
the frost kills them in whatever
form they remain to brave it. All summer
long their long, red wings bear
them bravely from one clump of milkweed
to another. They sip the honey
which each floret of the umbels holds
forth, the sticky mass the size of a pinhead.
They lay their eggs upon its
leaves and the black and yellow caterpillars
hatch and feed there. Then
they hang in a green and gold chrysalis
from a nearby twig till the imago, the
perfect butterfly, bursts its bonds and
sails away to find more milkweed.
There may be several broods of a summer,
but the frost stops all that. The
monarch may not winter here, nor may
his eggs or chrysalids survive the
cold.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</span>Many butterflies, frail though they
seem, do pass the New England winter
successfully. The <i>Antiopa vanessa</i>,
otherwise known as mourning-cloak or
Camberwell beauty, a handsome brown
fellow with blue spots and a pale-yellow
margin, well known to every one, flits
joyously through the woods with the
very first warm days of spring. He has
been snugged up in some dry crevice,
numbed and torpid, but very much alive,
all winter. The first genial warmth
sets him free, and later I always find
his children browsing on the willow
twigs over in the cove. They are rough
chaps, horrid with bristling black spines
and with dull red spots relieving their
otherwise plain black hides. But they
grow fast, and by and by go out upon a
twig and hang themselves, head down,
by a little silken rope, swinging there in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</span>
the wind, simply a dead caterpillar that
has imitated Judas.</p>

<p>One day the caterpillar part sloughs
off. It is a fairly sudden process. You
may paddle by the willows in the morning
and see all your little Judases hanging
in a row. Paddle back at noon and
their skins have shrivelled and slipped
off, and you have chrysalids, queer,
impish-looking things, swinging there
still, head down. You know they are
alive; indeed, if you poke them they will
wiggle impatiently, but they swing in
the wind and give no other sign for a
week or ten days. Then they cast a
second skin, and pop out full-grown butterflies
that stretch their wings for a
time leisurely, then suddenly dash into
the air and go off over the hill like
mad. The whole thing is so sudden!
The change, when it does come, is as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</span>
if some woodland magician had waved a
willow wand and said &#8220;Abra-ca-dabra;
presto, change!&#8221; Time and again I
have watched to see that caterpillar
skin fall off, and again to see the vanessa
step forth from the domino in
which it has been masquerading, but
they have always been too quick for
me.</p>

<p>Other butterflies survive in the
chrysalis all winter and come forth full-grown
and fit in the spring. Such may
speak to your listening imagination
through their beauty, which is often
great, or through their resurrection
from seeming death, though if you will
observe them closely in the chrysalid
form you will see that they are not
even seemingly dead. Evangelists who
have held up the butterfly to us as a
prototype of that resurrection which we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</span>
may expect if we are good, evidently
never closely observed the chrysalis of a
good healthy butterfly, else they had not
been so sure of their corpse.</p>

<p>Lately I have had chrysalids of the
<i>Papilio asterias</i>, the common eastern
swallowtail, in my study. I found the
fat black and yellow worms on my parsley
and caged them. They soon hitched
themselves to the wire netting by their
tails, hanging from overhead on a slant,
their shoulders (so to speak) being supported
by a single loop of silk. If you
did but tap on the wire netting or scratch
it these chrysalids would wiggle and
jerk quite angrily, their action saying
plainly, &#8220;Can&#8217;t you let me alone? I&#8217;m
just having a nap!&#8221; No; it is plainly
no death and resurrection which makes
a butterfly. It is merely a caterpillar
who was dressed for the fancy ball all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</span>
the time. He came to the woodland
hall in his greatcoat. This he sheds
for a domino, in which he masquerades
for a time. Then he bursts forth for
the final festivities in a robe of princely
beauty.</p>

<p>My chrysalids did this only the other
day. Wonderful creatures of black
and yellow came forth, stretched their
wings till I could see the dainty shading
of blue and the peacock-feather eye
of red and black on the lower part of
the secondary wings; then, as I opened
the window they dashed madly away
as the vanessas do from willow twigs in
the cove. The butterfly has been held
up to us as an example of lazy dalliance.
I have never watched one that
was not as busy as a politician on election
day. Especially do those just
wakened from the chrysalis form rush<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</span>
away as if they knew all their work
was before them and they longed to be
at it.</p>

<p>Of them all the monarch is not the
most beautiful, but I rank him as surely
the ablest. His annual migration shows
him to have wonderful strength of
wing, and either much wisdom or an
extraordinarily developed instinct. Very
likely he has both. Further, through
accident pure and simple, or else a spirit
of adventure fostered by the joys of
long annual journey, he is steadily extending
his habitat to embrace the
known world. Originally of North
America only, he has within the last
dozen years taken ship for Australia,
where he has multiplied greatly in the
warmer regions, and has wandered again
over sea to Java, Sumatra, and followed
the flag into the Philippines. He is well<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</span>
established at the Cape de Verde Islands,
and is doing his best to be happy in
the pale sunshine of the south of England,
whence specimens are reported
yearly.</p>

<p class="ph1">THE RESTING TIME OF THE
BIRDS</p>
</div>


<p><span class="xlarge">T</span>HIS morning I heard the bluebirds
again for the first time for weeks.
They came up from the pasture to the
apple trees and sang their modest little
snatches of song in that shyly sweet, reserved
yet fond, manner which makes
the bluebird the best loved of all our
pasture birds. There have been no bluebirds
about my garden since the yegg
raid of late May and its resulting
tragedy. Now they are back, but there
is in their call a note of sadness which
indeed comes into the voice of every
bluebird as autumn approaches, though
I think it is accentuated in mine this
year.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</span>When I say yegg I mean English
sparrow, and if I could think of a
worse name, equally descriptive of him,
I would give it. This is the story of the
foul deed, only one of many, no doubt,
perpetrated by this cowardly crew. In
late March I put out in my garden three
bird boxes such as bluebirds love to
inhabit. These were immediately inspected
by the neighborhood flock of
English sparrows, just beginning to pair
off, and finally decided upon as undesirable,
perhaps because I had intentionally
placed no perch before the
door.</p>

<p>The English sparrow will build his
nest in any impossible place to which he
takes a fancy, but he greatly prefers, in
choosing a new site, one that has a convenient
perch close by the entrance. So
these undesirable citizens decided that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</span>
they did not care for my bird boxes and
let them alone, much to my delight.
Then came the bluebirds, bringing to
our cold, raw spring their flashes of
blue like bits of a heaven that is fairer
than ours, a blue that is hope and
dreams of happiness and all things noble
yet gentle. There is no color like it as
it glints across pale April skies and
blooms on trees that have been bare and
gray so long. So, too, no bird song is
so dear as theirs. It is but a wee,
melodious phrase which says again and
again, &#8220;Cheerily; cheerily.&#8221; Yet it
voices hope and contentment, and is so
purely the expression of the joy of
gentle, kindly lives that it touches all
that is fond and kindly in the listener.</p>

<p>Bluebirds will nest in the hollow of
the pasture apple tree or in a last year&#8217;s
flicker&#8217;s abandoned hole in a decayed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</span>
stump, but of all places they most love a
bird box near a dwelling, and, as I had
hoped, a pair came early in April to inspect
mine. They looked them all over
appreciatively, seeming with delightful
courtesy to the builder to find it hard to
choose, but finally settled upon one in
the pear tree, and began to build.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the yeggs had been watching
with jealous eyes, lurking in the
shrubbery, sneaking about the eaves and
making sallies in small numbers from
around the barn. The English sparrow
has been called pugnacious. He is nothing
of the kind. He does not love a
fight. Bird to bird, there is nothing too
small to whip him. I have seen a chipping
sparrow, which is the least among
the pasture sparrows, send the poltroon
scurrying to shelter with all his feathers
standing on end. A cock bluebird, fighting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</span>
like a gentleman, and like a gentleman
fighting only when he must, will
drive a half-dozen of them. The English
sparrow has the true instincts of the
browbeating coward, and loves to fight
only when in overwhelming numbers he
may attack a lone pasture bird without
danger to himself.</p>

<p>So trouble began with the building,
and for a week or so the warfare raged
from box to box, the cock bluebird boldly
defeating superior numbers again and
again, only to have his gentle wife annoyed
by other villains while he drove
the first away, and his nesting material
stolen in spite of him. Finally he resorted
to what looked to me like well-planned
and carefully executed strategy,
though it may have been merely that
fortune which favors the brave and persistent.
The pair abandoned the box in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</span>
the pear tree and started building in the
one nailed against the side of the barn.
The sparrows followed, of course. Then
the bluebirds went back to the pear-tree
box. The sparrows followed. The bluebirds
then started building in the third
box and daily brought material to each
of the three, though ostensibly, I thought,
to the second and third. At any rate
the sparrows seemed to concentrate their
attention more on these boxes. Meanwhile
the bluebirds quietly completed the
nest in the pear tree and later laid their
eggs there, in comparative peace.</p>


<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i180.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">The English sparrow has the true instincts of the browbeating
coward</p>

<p>The sparrows did not build in either
of the other boxes. They did not want
to. Neither did they care particularly
about the material which they stole, for
they did not continue to take it after
the bluebirds had finished the pear-tree
nest and were in a position to defend<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</span>
it. Their action was simply hoodlumism
of the lowest and most despicable
kind.</p>


<p>This was bad enough, yet it was merely
petty annoyance compared to the deed
without a name of which they were later
to be guilty. The two young birds in
the bluebird box were more than half
grown. The blue was beginning to show
in their wings along with the white of
the conspicuous, growing quills, and the
fuscous margin was already touching the
breast feathers. The old birds, working
with tremendous energy to feed these
hearty youngsters, were both busy and
often away from the nest together.</p>

<p>At one such time the English sparrows
descended upon this nest, entered,
drove the young birds out to die upon
the ground, unnoticed in the long grass,
and started to take full possession. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</span>
bluebirds, returning too late, drove them
away with more than usual despatch.
This first called the affair to my attention.
But I was too late.</p>

<p>The young birds were dead and the
sparrows were chattering in raucous
jubilation over it, now and then giving
a squeak of fright or pain as the male
bluebird singled out an individual and
attacked him with a fury of which I
had not believed him capable. Soon,
however, he ceased, and the two twittered
mournfully about the tree for
hours, again and again poising in fluttering
flight before the door of their despoiled
home and looking eagerly in, as
if they could not believe that the young
were indeed gone. Later they went silently
away. No doubt they found another
home in some hollow tree of the
remote pasture and raised another brood.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</span>
But my boxes have stood tenantless ever
since.</p>

<p>The worst of it is there is little I
could do either in the way of prevention
or revenge. I did get out my big old
ten-bore duck gun, which I have not had
the heart to use on a bird, even a coot,
for a dozen years, and began cannonading
the miscreants, but this was more
disturbing to the neighbors than to the
sparrows.</p>

<p>One of the gentlest nature lovers I
ever knew, wise in bird ways and very
fond of all birds, used to say that he
wished all the English sparrows in the
world had but one neck, and that he
might have that neck in his hands. I
wish he might, too.</p>

<p>So, after weeks of absence, the bluebirds
have come back. Their speckle-breasted
young, which they would have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</span>
brought up among my apple trees and
in the cloistered seclusion of the lilac
bushes, have grown up in the pasture
instead, and very likely their plans for
next year will include the pasture wild-apple
tree rather than my bird box, and
they are far shyer and less responsive
to my advances than they would have
been. Their song has in it a plaint of
autumnal regret. In the spring they
sang, &#8220;Cheerily; cheerily.&#8221; Now they
say, &#8220;Going away; going away.&#8221; It
has in it something of the quality of
&#8220;Lochaber no more.&#8221;</p>

<p>But it is not merely the bluebirds
which have been silent for some weeks
and are now beginning to sing again.
The time between early July and mid-August
is a period of retirement for all
birddom. The mating season, with its
soul-stirring ecstasies, the labor of nest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</span>
building, the anxieties of brooding, have
been followed by the tremendous exertion
of caring for that nestful of young
birds. A healthy fledgling will eat almost
his own weight of food in a day, and by
the time he is able to fly and chase the
old birds around for more the father and
mother are worn to a frazzle. I really
believe the youngsters are weaned only
when their demand for food becomes so
enormous with their completed growth
that the parents cease to supply it
through sheer physical exhaustion.</p>

<p>I once reared a pair of young crows
by hand, taking them from the home nest
in a big pine, leaving three others&mdash;quite
enough I afterward thought&mdash;for
the parent birds. They were negroid,
naked, pod-bodied creatures at the time,
with long clutchy claws, ridiculous stubs
of wings, and, ye gods, what mouths!<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</span>
When I fed them I used to clutch something
with one hand lest I fall in. And
I was incessantly feeding them. Anxious
to treat them kindly and finding
that frogs were a most acceptable diet
to them I depopulated the township of
<i>Rana virescens</i> and allied species. Then
I found that fish would do about as well,
and I fished until there began to be a
shortage of angle-worms in the community.
Yet still the creatures grew
apace and demanded more food.</p>

<p>By and by they got big enough to use
their wings and, recognizing me as their
undoubted parent, came flapping and
clawing after me wherever I went, yelling,
&#8220;Caw, caw, ca-aw-aw,&#8221; in most
heartrending crescendo. Then did I
realize to the full the responsibility of
being a father bird. Stuff those clamorous
creatures as I might, they still pleaded<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</span>
in agonizing tones for more, and no one
not cognizant of the facts would have
believed that they were ever fed. The
lamb that loved Mary so, and followed
her also, was not a circumstance to the
clamorous devotion of those two young
crows toward me, their foster parent.</p>

<p>My one fear for weeks was that the
resident agent for the S. P. C. A., who
was a vigilant and tender-hearted lady
of undoubted indiscretion, would hear
their evidently unanswered appeals and
proceed against me. She could have
convicted me on the evidence in any district
court in Norfolk County; and yet
those young birds were eating everything
there was in the place outside of cold
storage.</p>

<p>Such is the appetite of the growing
bird. Yet there comes a time in the
passing of the summer when the youngsters<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</span>
are taught, or learn through necessity,
to forage for themselves and
cease their fritinancy. Then the thickets
are strangely silent. The youngsters no
longer yearn noisily and they have not
yet learned to sing. The old birds have
ceased singing. Indeed, there is nothing
left of them but their bones and feathers,
and that atmosphere of conscious rectitude
which comes with successful completion
of a noble and herculean task.
And then even their feathers begin to
go, for the moulting season is at hand.</p>

<p>No longer does the male scarlet tanager
sit like a lambent flame in the top
of a tree and warble, &#8220;Look-up, way-up,
look-at-me, treetop,&#8221; His scarlet suit
begins to fade, grow dingy, show signs
of wear, and finally go all to pieces while
he sits mute and dumpy in the shadow.
By and by the scarlet will have changed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</span>
completely to a dull olive-green, like that
of his inconspicuous mate, and though he
still retains the black of his wings and
tail you would not know him.</p>

<p>So the bobolink who swung so conspicuously
on the meadow grass in June
in his black and white suit comes through
the moulting season brown as a sparrow.
The vivid blue of the indigo bunting
falls from him in patches and is replaced
by grayish brown in a large measure.</p>

<p>No wonder that, utterly tired out and
their brilliant plumage scattered and
changed to dull and rusty colors, the
birds are silent for a time, waiting for
strength to recuperate. Some of them
seem to retain enough courage and vitality
to sing mornings through the moulting
season, notably the robins. I suspect,
though, that these faithful few&mdash;for the
robin singers of the morning of the first<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</span>
day of August will be as one to twenty
to those of the first day of June&mdash;are
gay young sports who did not care to
marry, or who, disappointed in love, still
sing to keep their courage up. It is the
best singers who are most strangely silent
now, as they have been for weeks; nor
will most of them be heard until next
spring, hereabouts.</p>

<p>My catbird was so sorrowfully unseen
and unheard that I began to think the
cat had got him, till I hunted him up,
down the hill among the scrub oaks.
He was as dilapidated and pass&eacute;-looking
as his nest in the lilacs; as if, like it,
the young birds had kicked him pretty
nearly to pieces before they got through
with him. But he perked up a bit when
he saw me, flipped an apology for a tail,
and miaued in a manner that was humorously
unlike him, it was so deprecatory.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</span>
But that was a week or ten days ago.
Yesterday I heard some bird cooing a
little song to himself out in the arbor-vit&aelig;
trees at the foot of the garden, and
slipping quietly up found that it was the
catbird again. He was quite sleek in his
new coat, and he was practising his song
in a delightful undertone, as if to be sure
that he should not forget it altogether.</p>

<p>In four or five weeks more he will
begin to flip saucily across the miles of
country that separate him from his winter
home in Southern Florida, or perhaps
farther yet in some stretch of primeval
forest that I myself have seen and loved
in the heart of Santo Domingo. He will
not sing his song there, high on some
giant ceiba or swinging on the plume
of some royal palm. He may not sing
it again here on the tip of the tallest
white lilac bush, but I know that, there<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</span>
or here, he will practise it now and then
in that soft, sweet undertone which you
would not believe of a catbird, and be
ready to send it forth in jubilant peals
when his strong wings bring him back
again next May. My bluebirds may
winter with him; and if they do I have
hopes that he may persuade them to try
my pear-tree box once more next spring.</p>

<p class="ph1">THE POND AT LOW TIDE</p>
</div>


<p><span class="xlarge">A</span>LL about the pond the woodland
folk are enjoying shore dinners, for it
is the time of ebb tide, and a wonderfully
low ebb at that. Not for a score
of years do I recall such low water.
Where, on the ebb of ordinary years, the
crow has been able to find one fresh-water
clam, he may now feed till he can
hold no more, for the drought has been
long and severe, and the pond has been
drained to the very dregs.</p>

<p>I say fresh-water clams, for that is
the name commonly applied to the creatures,
though I know that I might more
properly call them river mussels, and if
I wished to be severely scientific I should
say <i>Unio margaritifera</i>, though it is difficult<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</span>
to be sure of your margaritifera, as
there are about fifteen hundred species
of unios known to people who classify
creatures, and most of these are found
in the rivers of this country.</p>

<p>Little do the crows care for that. In
the sunny coves they have their clam-bakes,
and as I slip slyly up I fancy I
hear them smack their mandibles. As I
round the screen of shore-loving button
bushes, I know I shall come upon them,
and I expect to find them seated in
riotous fellowship, with napkins spread
across broad waistcoats, dipping delicious
mouthfuls in melted butter and tucking
them away behind the white napkins. I
have always missed the napkins and the
butter dishes, but the shells are proof
enough of what has been going on. If
the mother crow carries the table furnishings
away with her when she flies,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</span>
that is no more than human picnickers
do when driven from the sea beach.</p>

<p>The pond when full is ten feet deeper
than it is now. In May the water
lapped the forest roots on its edges; now
from the forest to the mud of the very
bottom where still the water lingers a
strip of slanting beach stretches for a
hundred yards. The crows are not the
only creatures which have made tracks
on this. Close by the edge in the soft
mud the heron has walked with dignity,
leaving footmarks that proceed precisely.
The heron may not have large ambitions,
but he is purposeful and does not turn
aside. The crows gurgled and ha-haed
over their clambake; the heron takes his
fish course as solemnly as if he were
taking the pledge.</p>

<p>All along you will see where the squirrels
have come down to drink, skipping<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</span>
vivaciously, taking a sip here, bouncing
away to examine something there, remembering
that they came for a drink
after all and taking a good one, then
hurrying back with long leaps in a
straight line for the trees. The squirrel
is not solemn, far from it, but he is
business-like, and though there is humorous
good fellowship in his every hop, he
nevertheless does not linger long from
his work.</p>


<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i198.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">The skunk doesn&#8217;t know where he is going and he isn&#8217;t even<br />
on his way</p>

<p>Very different from this is the track
of mister skunk. He wanders aimlessly
along, often as much sidewise as straight
ahead. The skunk doesn&#8217;t know where
he is going and he isn&#8217;t even on his
way. I never see his tracks, whether
on the pond shore or elsewhere, but I
renew my doubts as to his habits. He
is out much too late at night. His tracks
show it. I think he had his drink before<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</span>
he came to the water. Probably he too
knows how toothsome are the unios and
is searching for them in his maudlin
fashion.</p>

<p>Then there are the muskrats. They
do not have to wait for their clam banquets
till the water is low. They are
expert divers and gather the unios at
such times as suit their fancy. You will
see their tracks in regular runways in
the shallow water of the muddy coves,
whence they are apt to follow some
trickling streamlet to the bank where the
summer burrows are at high water.</p>

<p>Later, along the marshy edges you will
find their winter teepees, piled to conical
heights with sods and roots, with a
warm refuge above the ice and an exit
below, whence they may swim in search
of food. The tracks of the muskrats
show every mark of the industrious villager.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</span>
They stick close to well-traveled
paths, and though the muskrats are out
nights no one would for a moment
question their temperance and industry.
Their characters are excellent ones, beyond
suspicion, and their tracks show it.</p>

<p>On the pond shore at ebb tide the glaciers,
too, have left their tracks, though
it is probably several hundred thousand
years since any have been this way.
Where there are granite ledges you may
know that these were here before even
the glaciers stalked solemnly by, for
they show where the ice in grumbling
grandeur ground small stones against
them and gradually wore out ruts in the
enduring granite by force of attrition.</p>

<p>The track of the glacier is like the
trail of the serpent,&mdash;it leaves no toe-marks,
but its sliding progress is unmistakable.
Side by side with the ledge<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</span>
which shows these stri&aelig; you may see on
the soft mud imprints of this year&#8217;s
leaves, dropped a moment there by the
wind, then whirled away again, but
leaving their tracks behind them. This
mark of the season may be obliterated
by a breath, or it may be covered with
sifting silt and finally harden into sandstone
and bear the trail of the leaf as
far down the ages as has come that of
the glacier. Here are moments and &aelig;ons
elbowing one another for place.</p>

<p>Other interesting records of past time
may be read in Stumpy Cove, which is
still the wildest and most secluded of
spots, though the trolley tripper has found
the pond and builds his bungalows on its
shore, sinks his tin cans in its waters,
and scares the bullfrogs with his phonograph.
The tin cans will not last long,
however. Fresh water in motion is continually<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</span>
giving up oxygen, and this with
the humic acid of the mud bottom will
soon scatter these disfigurations in scales
of brown oxide. But all these solvent
forces, acting through two centuries,
have had little effect on the stumps of
Stumpy Cove.</p>

<p>The heart-wood is still sound, their
interlaced roots tell the story of what
happened on the spot in the rich muck
of the swamp, as Stumpy Cove was
then, before Myles Standish had set foot
on Plymouth Rock or the first white
man had spied inland from the summit
of Blue Hill. For the pond as it is now
is only about a hundred years old. For
a hundred years before that it was a
meadow, flowed occasionally by the
farmers of the region about it.</p>

<p>Before that Stumpy Cove was a great
white-cedar swamp and the great white<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</span>
cedars stood in it, two feet in diameter,
their clean straight trunks running up
fifty feet or more without a knob or
limb. This natural meadow with hay
for their cattle for the cutting, these
cedar swamps with their century-old
growth, were what attracted the first
settlers to this region, and hardly had
the dawn of the sixteenth century come
over the Blue Hills before their axes
were at work in Stumpy Cove and similar
swamps all about, getting out shingle
stuff for the Boston market. But
whereas in all the other swamps the
young cedars were allowed to grow in
again for succeeding generations of
woodsmen, here new conditions arose.</p>

<p>The meadow was flowed intermittently
for a century; then the pond grew out
of it. Not only might no seedlings find
roothold there, but the very black muck<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</span>
in which they might grow was washed
away from the roots of the great
stumps. These, in the main, have endured,
losing their bark and sap-wood,
but with the heart-wood still firm after
the lapse of two centuries.</p>

<p>Here at this ebb tide I read the record
of growth of trees that had their
beginnings more than three centuries ago.
These roots so twine and intertwine
that the original sap, drawn from the
tender tips, must have nourished any
one of several trees indifferently, for
heart-wood joins heart-wood in scores of
places near the stump and far from it,
showing that each tree stood not only
on its own roots, but on those of its
neighbors all about it; not only was it
nourished by its own rootlets, but by
those of trees near by. No gale could
uproot these swamp cedars. United they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</span>
stood and divided they might not fall.
It is a curious method of growth, and
I dare say it obtains in many swamps
where the white cedars stand close, but
under no other circumstances could it
have been revealed to me, casually strolling
that way three centuries after it
happened.</p>

<p>At high water all these curious roots
are submerged and you see only the
butts of the trees, numerous miniature
islands on which many an alien growth
has made port. Here in June the dour
and melancholy cassandra disputes the
footing of the wild rose, and the huckleberry
and sweet-fern twine in loving
companionship, afloat as ashore. Here intertwine
the sheep laurel and the hard-hack,
the meadow-sweet and the marsh
St. John&#8217;s-wort, garlanding the white
skeletons of the ancient trees and making<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</span>
them young again with the odorous
promises of spring.</p>

<p>In midsummer, among patches of
green and gray moss, you will find tiny,
diamond-like globules glistening. These
are the clear, dew-like drops of glutinous
liquid which gem the leaves of the
<i>Drosera</i>, northern representative of the
Venus&#8217;s fly-trap. This, the <i>Dionaea</i>,
catches flies by means of a steel-trap
leaf which closes on them when they
light on it. This other, the <i>Drosera</i>, is
not so active. It attracts insects with
its honey dew, holds them with sticky
glands, and grips them, little by little,
with bristles. It is a curious and beautiful
little plant, and one would hardly
think it carnivorous to see it adding its
diamond ornaments to the floral decorations
which beautify the ancient stumps
all summer long.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</span>Yet of all the life histories revealed
by the pond at low tide I still think that
of the <i>Unionid&aelig;</i> the most interesting.
You find them all along above and below
the margin of the shallow water, their
shells most wonderfully streaked with
olive-green and pale-yellow in alternate
bands, till one might think he had found
nodules of malachite which the long-ago
glacier had culled from some Labrador
ledge and ground to unsymmetrical ovoids
before it dropped them on the old-time
meadow marge. In certain individuals
and certain lights the shells of these obscure
creatures send out gleams of green
and gold, like gems that have soft fires
within them. It is as if an opalescent
soul dwelt within, and the thin shell
which a crow with his bill may puncture
with a blow was so constructed as to
hold in the reds and blues of the opalescence,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</span>
but transmit the greens and
gold.</p>

<p>You find many with only the backs
of their shells sticking out of the mud.
This may be the creature&#8217;s natural position,
but I find far more of them lying
quietly on their sides in the shallow water,
rocking gently to and fro in the placid
undulations as if they were there but to
show me their shining colors. But if
you watch one intently for a time you
will see him open his shell cautiously
and put out one foot. This is his best,
for it is all he has and he puts it foremost.
It is very white and clean, and
it might as well be called his tongue, for
with it he licks his food. It is half as
long as he is, and when he has put it
out as far as he can, or as far as he
dares, a fine white fringe grows on its
outer margin. Thus he gathers in minute<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</span>
animalcul&aelig; or refuse matter from
the surface of the mud, for his stomach&#8217;s
sake.</p>

<p>It is a rather interesting thing to
stand by and watch a <i>Unio margaritifera</i>
daintily putting away his own particular
brand of little necks and mock
turtle. At the least untoward sign of
interest in the affair, however, he shuts
up like a clam, and you will need your
pocket-knife if you wish to see more of
him.</p>

<p>Where the water is only an inch deep
or so over the soft ooze of the bottom
you will see where the unio has used
this so-called foot as a foot should be
used, for he not only stands on it, but
walks with its help. These signs are
curiously erratic marks drawn as with a
sharpened stick for a distance sometimes
of yards. If you will inspect the seaward<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</span>
end of this trail you will find a
unio in it, generally a young one, for it
is he that has left the mark behind him
in his travels. For the unio at a certain
age is a great traveller; that is, when
he is very young. The adults foot it,
but the young before they reach their
full growth ride, some of them by what
you might call the lightning expresses of
the pond world.</p>

<p>If you will split a big one at this time
of year you will be likely to find within
an astonishing number of eggs. These
are carried in brood pouches that seem
to occupy pretty nearly all the space between
the shells. In seeing them you
wonder vaguely where there was room
for the bearer of this amazing progeny.
Just where they are these young unios
grow to maturity of a certain sort,
forming minute shells which have hooks,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</span>
forming also peculiar organs of sense.
The hooks and the sense organs are
provided that they may not miss that
free ride which is the privilege of every
young unio if he is to reach the period
of adolescence.</p>

<p>At the moment of being sent forth
from the home shell the golchidium, for
that is what the scientific men call the
unio at this stage of the affair, begins
to hunt, aided by his sense organs, for
a thoroughfare. Here he takes the first
conveyance, whether the slow coach of
the sluggish horn-pout, the bream automobile,
or the pickerel flying-machine.
To the first fish that comes by he attaches
himself, oftentimes to the gills,
and there he rides and, like most travelers,
continues to develop.</p>

<p>By and by, being &#8220;finished&#8221; by travel,
he gets off his vehicle at some convenient<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</span>
station, drops into the mud, and is ready
to lecture, or so I fancy it, before any
of the unio women&#8217;s clubs on the world
as he has seen it. Not until then does
the unio, and then only if he is a margaritifera,
begin to accumulate pearls.</p>

<p>By what mystery of sunlight and shallow
water the unio has acquired the lucent
green and gold of the epidermis of his
outer shell I do not know, any more
than I know what pigments paint or
what naiad fingers hold the brush that
paints the gold in the heart or the pinky
green in the outer sepals of the water-lily.
The two find their sustenance in
the same mud.</p>

<p>But even if I could tell this I might
well pause in wonder over the beauty of
the inner shell of this pulseless creature
of the ooze. Perhaps the golchidium,
darting back and forth beneath the ripples<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</span>
of the surface during its days of
travel, catches the radiant blue of the sky,
the rosy flush of dawn, and the glory of
the rainbow all shivered together in exultant
light to make the nacre of the
inner surface of its growing shell. For
nowhere else in nature may we find such
softness of coloring holding such gleams
of azure and of fire. The opal beside it
is garish and crude. Mother-of-pearl we
call it, for out of the same source is
born the gem which may be worth the
price of a king&#8217;s ransom.</p>

<p>The unio is the good girl of the fairy
tale, for from its lips fall pearls that
confound the divers of the Orient. Not
from Ceylon nor Sulu nor the Straits of
Sunda nor the Gulf of California have
come such pearls of bewildering color
and fascinating shapes as have been
taken from the river mussels of our<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</span>
American streams. For all I know the
shallows of my pond may hold a necklace
of such value that its fellow has
never yet circled the throat of a queen.
If so I hope no one will ever find it out,
for an ebb tide such as this comes only
once in a score or so of years, and when
the next one is here I want still to find
the beach beautiful with the green and
gold and mother-of-pearl of the unios.</p>

<p><span class="xlarge">T</span>HE <i>Spiranthes gracilis</i> is commonly
called ladies&#8217; tresses, which is a very
polite name for it, for nothing can be
more beautiful than the tresses of ladies.
It is like its name in that it is beautiful,
but not otherwise, for it is a flower
not of tresses, but of fine eyelashes of
pearl set in a spiral on jade. The rain
this morning dropped transparent, colorless
pearl tears on the tips of these eyelashes,
and as they twinkled toward shy
smiles the tears ran down the spiral to
be eagerly kissed away by the small
grasses that always cling about the feet
of the spiranthes in mute adoration.</p>

<p>Near by slender varieties of gerardia
held up rosy cups to drink these clear<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</span>
pearls, finding in them a medicine that
shall cure all ills. In the rain the fountain
of youth wells up in the cup of
every flower that waits in the soft pasture
grasses and the grasses themselves
drink eagerly. The cedars deck themselves
in these clear pearls, wearing
garments fringed with them and ropes
and necklaces without number, and letting
their prim propriety be so softened
that they are no longer firm and erect
but take on curves of soft roundness
that should go with pearl-embroidered
garments.</p>

<p>Yesterday there was in all the pasture
people a certain puritanical sternness of
demeanor, a set holding fast to the narrowing
good of life, a tightening of the
muscles that are weary with a long
strain but may not for the good of the
soul loose their firm grip, for yesterday<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</span>
the pasture was dry and hard with the
leanness of the long summer drought.</p>

<p>To-day has come the first of the fall
rains and these puritans are stern and
set no longer, but relax into swaying
curves of lissome beauty that entrance
you. It is as if, after coming as you
thought to a Sunday service of the old
Calvinists, you found it transformed into
a grange picnic of wood nymphs.</p>

<p>The pines indeed, which always stretch
out their arms in Sabbath-like benediction,
seem asking a pious blessing on all
these, their pasture children; and they
fold their slim leaves together like hands
in a soft prayer of thankfulness. But
the soft rain cuddles them as well, and
before they know it they are decked with
the clear pearls as for a bridal and their
plumes nod in reverence, yet are so
beautiful in gems and there is such a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</span>
soft grace in their curves&mdash;they that
stood so grim and sombre before&mdash;that
each tree seems like some bounteous and
beautiful woman, arrayed for wedding
festivities, who yet bows a moment at
a sanctuary in prayer, even as she joins
the guests.</p>

<p>The rain had been long coming. A
solitary quail predicted it; the first I
have heard since the severe cold and
deep snows of three winters in succession
not long ago. I had thought every
quail smothered in the white depths or
frozen by the bitter cold. Three years
is a long time not to hear a quail
whistle, and this I believe to be no survivor
of the old stock, but one that has
worked up from Southern fields where
the snows were less deadly during those
rigid winters.</p>

<p>It is pretty hard to tell whether a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</span>
quail is simply announcing his own name
for all who care to hear, or making a
weather prediction. Jotham, one of the
farmer&#8217;s men who knows all, says it is
simple enough. In an announcement he
says, &#8220;Bob, Bob White.&#8221; The weather
prediction is different. Then he says,
&#8220;Wet, more wet.&#8221; All you have to do
is listen.</p>

<p>This is like Jotham&#8217;s grandmother&#8217;s
recipe for making soap. You collected
potash from the hearth, added water in
an iron kettle, and boiled till a certain
thickness was reached. You would know
this point by placing an egg on the surface,
and if the concoction was right the
egg would either sink or swim, the old
lady was blessed if she could remember
which. This is a way that successful
oracles have. That one at Delphos
did it.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</span>So, when my lone quail sat on a rock
in the pasture, tipped his head back a
little, swelled his white throat and
whistled, round and clear, I went out
to meet him, scanning the sky meanwhile
for a change of weather. The sky of
the day before had been like a brass
bowl shut down over the gasping land.
Shrubs of the upland hung their leaves
piteously, the tougher herbs wilted, and
the tenderer ones dried up and died.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i222.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">My lone quail sat on a rock in the pasture, tipped his head back<br />
a little, swelled his white throat, and whistled</p>

<p>On such days when the long summer
drought has wreaked its worst, when the
parched pasture lies on its back, open-mouthed,
gasping for water, when even
the pond which has given so freely for
the refreshment of the pasture people
has shrunk back upon itself till a rod-wide
rim of gravel and rough stones
forbids them to come down and drink, I
love to go down to the water&#8217;s edge and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</span>
marvel at the hedge hyssop. All along
the shore the summer drought forbids
the water weeds to grow. This rod-wide
space is not for them. The flood of the
winter and spring denies other land
plants a roothold; yet, just when you
think the shore is to be bare and barren
for always, troops forth the hedge hyssop
and clothes it with verdure, lighted
with a golden smile.</p>

<p>The common name of the plant seems
to me to express ingenuity rather than
purpose. It has nothing to do with
hedges and is not a hyssop, which is a
garden plant belonging with thyme and
lavender and other sweet herbs beloved
of old ladies in kerchief caps and figured
gowns. The hedge hyssop is none of
these. Nine months of the twelve it
bides its time under water. During the
other three it glows in golden contentment<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</span>
on the sandy stretches left bare by
this yearly receding tide, climbing along
the rocky shore and filling every crevice,
lifting its yellow cups to the glare of the
brazen sky and distilling subtle perfume
to the antenn&aelig; of the little low-flying
insects that are its friends. Yet if its
common name means little, that given it
by the botanists fits. <i>Gratiola aurea</i> may
well mean a plant that is golden grace
or a golden benediction, as you choose
to take the Latin.</p>

<p>The day before, then, I had no heart
for the upland pasture, but Jotham&#8217;s
reading of the quail had been the right
one, for yesterday the brazen look was
all blown out of the sky by the south
wind. It did not leave it clear blue, for
that would have meant cooler and still
dry, but put into it a pallor that seemed
to well up from all the horizon round.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</span>
It was not the pallor of clouds, for there
was not even a cumulus thunder head
in sight, but the pallor that comes with
the wind that has a storm behind it, yet
is to blow itself out before the storm
arrives.</p>

<p>The cuckoo, flitting jerkily from one
thicket to the next, noted this pallor
from the corner of his eye and thenceforth
through the day croaked to himself
as he went his caterpillar-hunting
rounds. &#8220;Clackity clack; tut, tut; cow,
cow, cow,&#8221; he clucked musically, which
is his way of saying, &#8220;Oh dear, it is
going to rain and the caterpillars will
be all soggy.&#8221; Jotham says the early
settlers out here in the Dorchester backwoods
taught the cuckoo to work for
them, but that he was so lazy that their
descendants, getting better help, gave it
up, and that the cuckoo soon forgot all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</span>
he knew about farm work except calling
the cows.</p>

<p>Every bluejay is a born tease, and in
the late August drought goes about crying
&#8220;Rain, rain,&#8221; because he knows there
will be no rain. He does it merely to
fool the pasture people and then chuckle
in his phonograph twang over their
misery when no rain comes.</p>

<p>Yesterday when he smelt the south
wind and saw that sky pallor he stopped
calling &#8220;Rain, rain,&#8221; for he knew it was
coming. Instead he fluttered round and
round the pasture, ducking in among the
boughs of the pines and ejaculating, as
if he were surprised to find it so, &#8220;Clear,
clear.&#8221; I fancy all the wild creatures
of wood and pasture know the signs
better than I do and could announce the
rain if they would long before I know
that it is coming. All the outdoor world<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</span>
was sure of it yesterday. With the very
first show of that paleness in the sky&mdash;or
was it something in the touch of the
wind?&mdash;the drooping plants lifted their
leaves to be ready for it. I could smell
it in the falling of the wind at sunset;
they seemed to smell it in mid-forenoon
while yet the wind was rising.</p>

<p>On such days looking across the pond
toward wind and sun there is a peculiar
blink in the light reflected from the surface
of the waves which you do not see
if fair weather is ahead of you. The
pale sky seems to reflect blackly in the
water. Down to leeward the shore poplars
stand silvery white, a quivering,
flashing silver under the lash of the
wind. The swamp maples lose their
green and turn pale and the willows
lighten up in color.</p>

<p>It is the turning of the leaves in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</span>
wind. You may say that they would
turn in any wind and show their lighter
under sides, and this is true, yet there
is a difference in the appearance when
it is a rain-bringing wind. I cannot tell
you why this should be, but the difference
is there. It may be that a moist
wind relaxes the tension of the petioles
more than a dry one and thus lets the
leaf lie flatter, giving a little different
look to the tree as a whole. The
weather-wise older people grew up on
the land instead of within walls and
they were wont to say, &#8220;The leaves are
turning in the wind and it is going to
rain.&#8221; Like the pasture people they
knew.</p>

<p>By nightfall the weather bureau suspected
something but was not quite sure
what. They hung out the &#8220;possible
rain&#8221; flag, and all the crows in the pinewood,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</span>
congregating now in bigger and
bigger flocks, practising, I take it, for
their labor-day parade, went into fits
of laughter. &#8220;Haw, haw, haw!&#8221; they
shouted, and whirled up into the sky
and took a look about and dashed down
again, convulsed. &#8220;Haw, haw, haw!
Possible rain; here&#8217;s the sky just ready
to spill out a twenty-four hour soaker!&#8221;</p>

<p>The wind went down with the sun,
and the willow and maple leaves were
green again for a little before they
faded into the growing purple of the
dusk, but with every faint sigh of the
failing breeze the poplars loomed white
again with a radiant ghostliness which
seemed to people the rustling dusk with
softly phosphorescent spooks. You will
see these other-world visitors to the
pond shore only on such a night when
the wind is right.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</span>There was no glow of rich color in
the sky at sunset. Instead the dusk
hung violet gray draperies all about the
horizon,&mdash;curtains that veiled but did
not hide the evening stars, shutting them
almost out near the horizon and leaving
them comparatively clear at the zenith.
In such dusk stars do not twinkle, they
blink, and that is a sign of rain which
all the pasture people that have eyes
know well.</p>

<p>Those that have ears and no eyes may
know what sort of a night it is as well,
for there is some quality in such an atmosphere
which makes sounds carry far.
The rap of a paddle on a canoe seat a
mile away up the pond sounds right in
your ear. A train roaring through the
wood three miles distant seems so near
that you involuntarily look around lest
it be coming behind and run over you.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</span>
On such nights speak low if you do not
wish the whole world to hear, for the
air all about you is a wireless telephone
receiver tuned to your pitch. Those
gray rain curtains which the dusk has
hung all about the horizon have made
the whole world a whispering gallery.</p>

<p>Sometime in the night the wind dies.
It passes away so peacefully that no
mirror held to its lips would note that
last sigh. But the stars have known it
all the evening, and that is why their
eyes blinked so. It was to keep back
the tears. Then the stars vanish and the
night is dark indeed.</p>

<p>Scents carry far on such a night, not
only those of the pasture world, which
are pleasant, but those of the more distant
town, which sometimes are not.
The air is not only telephonic but telefumic.
The distant leather factory sends<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</span>
out a faint but characteristic odor by
which you might hunt it across country
for a lustrum of miles. The sooty
emanation from my neighbors&#8217; chimneys
is pungent in my nostrils, though their
houses are a mile away. I think I can
tell which is which, for the fireplace
smell differs from that of the furnace,
as does that of the parlor stove from the
range. Agreeably these are forgotten,
for something has crushed sassafras
leaves over on the pasture knoll and the
fine fragrance comes to drive away
thoughts of the others.</p>

<p>As the night was gray, which foretells
rain, so the morning breaks crimson,
which announces it. No bird heralds
this dawn, no chirping insect sends its
voice questing through its shades. The
sky hardly lightens up; it is rather that
the darkness turns red. Nor does the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</span>
light come from the sky when it does
come. It wells up from the earth instead,
for when the crimson is gone the
sky is still black with shadows, while the
pasture grows distinct in a gray outline
wherein is no color.</p>

<p>A stillness of expectation broods all
things,&mdash;a stillness so intense that the
first rain-drop sounds like a pistol-shot
as it strikes a leaf near you. Then
there is a volley and further silence for
a brief space, followed by a crepitation
all about you. Those first heavy drops
have been followed by lighter ones, and
this crepitation merges into a steady
drumming, which becomes a low roar
to your ears made sensitive by silence
and faint sounds. The first of the fall
rains has come, and the summer suffering
of the pasture people is at an end.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG&#8482;
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away--you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark
license, especially commercial redistribution.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work (any work
on which the phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; appears, or with which the
phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you
    are not located in the United States, you will have to check the laws
    of the country where you are located before using this eBook.
  </div>
</blockquote>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg&#8482; License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg&#8482;.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; License.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,

unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
provided that:
</div>

<div style='margin-left:0.7em;'>
    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &bull; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are

        &bull; You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies

        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        works.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &bull; You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal

LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you &#8216;AS-IS&#8217;, WITH NO

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>
